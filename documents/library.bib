Spitzer combines the intrinsic sensitivity achievable with a cryogenic telescope in space with the great imaging and spectroscopic power of modern detector arrays to provide the user community with huge gains in capability for
exploration of the cosmos in the infrared. The observatory systems are largely performing as expected, and the projected cryogenic lifetime is in excess of 5 years. This paper summarizes the on-orbit scientific, technical, and operational performance of Spitzer. Subsequent papers in this special issue describe the Spitzer instruments in detail and highlight many of the exciting scientific results obtained during the first 6 months of the Spitzer mission.},

	abstract = {We present a catalog covering 1.62 deg2 of the 
COSMOS/UltraVISTA field with point-spread function (PSF) matched
photometry in 30 photometric bands. The catalog covers the wavelength
range 0.15-24 Î¼m including the available GALEX, Subaru,
Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, VISTA, and Spitzer data. Catalog sources
have been selected from the DR1 UltraVISTA Ks band imaging
that reaches a depth of K s, tot = 23.4 AB (90\%
completeness). The PSF-matched catalog is generated using
position-dependent PSFs ensuring accurate colors across the entire
field. Also included is a catalog of photometric redshifts (z
phot) for all galaxies computed with the EAZY code.
Comparison with spectroscopy from the zCOSMOS 10k bright sample shows
that up to z {\textasciitilde} 1.5 the z phot are accurate to Îz/(1 +
z) = 0.013, with a catastrophic outlier fraction of only 1.6\%. The z
phot also show good agreement with the z phot from
the NEWFIRM Medium Band Survey out to z {\textasciitilde} 3. A catalog of stellar masses
and stellar population parameters for galaxies determined using the FAST
spectral energy distribution fitting code is provided for all galaxies.
Also included are rest-frame U - V and V - J colors, L
2800 and L IR. The UVJ color-color diagram
confirms that the galaxy bi-modality is well-established out to z {\textasciitilde} 2.
Star-forming galaxies also obey a star-forming "main sequence" out to z
{\textasciitilde} 2.5, and this sequence evolves in a manner consistent with previous
measurements. The COSMOS/UltraVISTA Ks -selected catalog
covers a unique parameter space in both depth, area, and
multi-wavelength coverage and promises to be a useful tool for studying
the growth of the galaxy population out to z {\textasciitilde} 3-4.

These include data taken on the Subaru 8.3 m telescope, the KPNO and CTIO 4 m telescopes, and the CFHT 3.6 m telescope. Special techniques are used to ensure that the relative photometric calibration is better than 1\% across the field of view. The absolute photometric accuracy from standard-star measurements is found to be 6\%. The absolute calibration is corrected using galaxy spectra, providing colors accurate to 2\% or better. Stellar and galaxy colors and counts agree well with the expected values. Finally, as the first step in the scientific analysis of these data we construct panchromatic number counts which confirm that both the geometry of the universe and the galaxy population are evolving.

	abstract = {The Spitzer Extended Deep Survey (SEDS) is a very deep infrared survey within ï¬ve well-known extragalactic science ï¬elds: the UKIDSS Ultra-Deep Survey, the Extended Chandra Deep Field South, COSMOS, the Hubble Deep Field North, and the Extended Groth Strip. SEDS covers a total area of 1.46 deg2 to a depth of 26 AB mag (3Ï ) in both of the warm Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) bands at 3.6 and 4.5 Î¼m. Because of its uniform depth of coverage in so many widely-separated ï¬elds, SEDS is subject to roughly 25\% smaller errors due to cosmic variance than a single-ï¬eld survey of the same size. SEDS was designed to detect and characterize galaxies from intermediate to high redshifts (z = 2â7) with a built-in means of assessing the impact of cosmic variance on the individual ï¬elds. Because the full SEDS depth was accumulated in at least three separate visits to each ï¬eld, typically with six-month intervals between visits, SEDS also furnishes an opportunity to assess the infrared variability of faint objects. This paper describes the SEDS survey design, processing, and publicly-available data products. Deep IRAC counts for the more than 300,000 galaxies detected by SEDS are consistent with models based on known galaxy populations. Discrete IRAC sources contribute 5.6 Â± 1.0 and 4.4 Â± 0.8 nW mâ2 srâ1 at 3.6 and 4.5 Î¼m to the diffuse cosmic infrared background (CIB). IRAC sources cannot contribute more than half of the total CIB ï¬ux estimated from DIRBE data. Barring an unexpected error in the DIRBE ï¬ux estimates, half the CIB ï¬ux must therefore come from a diffuse component.},

             imaging observations covering a 30â² Ã 30â² area of the Extended Chandra Deep Field-South (ECDFS) carried out by our Taiwan ECDFS Near-Infrared Survey (TENIS). The median 5Ï limiting magnitudes for all detected objects in the ECDFS reach 24.5 and 23.9Â mag (AB) for J and KS
            , respectively. In the inner 400Â arcmin2 region where the sensitivity is more uniform, objects as faint as 25.6 and 25.0Â mag are detected at 5Ï. Thus, this is by far the deepest J and KS
             data sets available for the ECDFS. To combine TENIS with the Spitzer IRAC data for obtaining better spectral energy distributions of high-redshift objects, we developed a novel deconvolution technique (IRACLEAN) to accurately estimate the IRAC fluxes. IRACLEAN can minimize the effect of blending in the IRAC images caused by the large point-spread functions and reduce the confusion noise. We applied IRACLEAN to the images from the Spitzer IRAC/MUSYC Public Legacy in the ECDFS survey (SIMPLE) and generated a J+KS
            -selected multi-wavelength catalog including the photometry of both the TENIS near-infrared and the SIMPLE IRAC data. We publicly release the data products derived from this work, including the J and KS
             images and the J+KS
            -selected multi-wavelength catalog.}

        survey. To identify and mask the saturated stars in the full
        HSC-SSP footprint, we rely on the Gaia and Tycho-2 star
        catalogues. We first assemble a pure star catalogue down to
        G$_{Gaia}$ $\lt$ 18 after removing {\ensuremath{\sim}}1.5\% of
        sources that appear extended in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
        (SDSS). We perform visual inspection on the early data from the
        S16A internal release of HSC-SSP, finding that our star
        catalogue is 99.2\% pure down to G$_{Gaia}$ $\lt$ 18. Second, we
        build the mask regions in an automated way using stacked
        detected source measurements around bright stars binned per
        G$_{Gaia}$ magnitude. Finally, we validate those masks by visual
        inspection and comparison with the literature of galaxy number
        counts and angular two-point correlation functions. This version
        (Arcturus) supersedes the previous version (Sirius) used in the
        S16A internal and DR1 public releases. We publicly release the

	abstract = {We introduce the Illustris Project, a series of large-scale hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation. The highest resolution simulation, Illustris-1, covers a volume of \$(106.5\,\{\rm Mpc\}){\textasciicircum}3\$, has a dark mass resolution of \$\{6.26 \times 10{\textasciicircum}\{6\}\,\{\rm M\}\_\odot\}\$, and an initial baryonic matter mass resolution of \$\{1.26 \times 10{\textasciicircum}\{6\}\,\{\rm M\}\_\odot\}\$. At \$z=0\$ gravitational forces are softened on scales of \$710\,\{\rm pc\}\$, and the smallest hydrodynamical gas cells have an extent of \$48\,\{\rm pc\}\$. We follow the dynamical evolution of \$2\times 1820{\textasciicircum}3\$ resolution elements and in addition passively evolve \$1820{\textasciicircum}3\$ Monte Carlo tracer particles reaching a total particle count of more than \$18\$ billion. The galaxy formation model includes: primordial and metal-line cooling with self-shielding corrections, stellar evolution, stellar feedback, gas recycling, chemical enrichment, supermassive black hole growth, and feedback from active galactic nuclei. At \$z=0\$ our simulation volume contains about \$40,000\$ well-resolved galaxies covering a diverse range of morphologies and colours including early-type, late-type and irregular galaxies. The simulation reproduces reasonably well the cosmic star formation rate density, the galaxy luminosity function, and baryon conversion efficiency at \$z=0\$. It also qualitatively captures the impact of galaxy environment on the red fractions of galaxies. The internal velocity structure of selected well-resolved disk galaxies obeys the stellar and baryonic Tully-Fisher relation together with flat circular velocity curves. In the well-resolved regime the simulation reproduces the observed mix of early-type and late-type galaxies. Our model predicts a halo mass dependent impact of baryonic effects on the halo mass function and the masses of haloes caused by feedback from supernova and active galactic nuclei.},

	abstract = {We use the hydrodynamical EAGLE simulation to study the magnitude and origin of the scatter in the stellar mass - halo mass relation for central galaxies. We separate cause and effect by correlating stellar masses in the baryonic simulation with halo properties in a matched dark matter only (DMO) simulation. The scatter in stellar mass increases with redshift and decreases with halo mass. At \$z = 0.1\$ it declines from 0.25 dex at \$M\_\{200, \rm DMO\} \approx 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}\$ M\$\_\{\odot\}\$ to 0.12 dex at \$M\_\{200, \rm DMO\} \approx 10{\textasciicircum}\{13\}\$ M\$\_\{\odot\}\$, but the trend is weak above \$10{\textasciicircum}\{12\}\$ M\$\_\{\odot\}\$. For \$M\_\{200, \rm DMO\} {\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}\{12.5\}\$ M\$\_\{\odot\}\$ up to 0.04 dex of the scatter is due to scatter in the halo concentration. At fixed halo mass, a larger stellar mass corresponds to a more concentrated halo. This is likely because higher concentrations imply earlier formation times and hence more time for accretion and star formation, and/or because feedback is less efficient in haloes with higher binding energies. The maximum circular velocity, \$V\_\{\rm max, DMO\}\$, and binding energy are therefore more fundamental properties than halo mass, meaning that they are more accurate predictors of stellar mass, and we provide fitting formulae for their relations with stellar mass. However, concentration alone cannot explain the total scatter in the \$M\_\{\rm star\} - M\_\{200, \rm DMO\}\$ relation, and it does not explain the scatter in \$M\_\{\rm star\} -V\_\{\rm max, DMO\}\$. Halo spin, sphericity, triaxiality, substructure and environment are also not responsible for the remaining scatter, which thus could be due to more complex halo properties or non-linear/stochastic baryonic effects.},

Our most accurate model follows the collapse, the star formation history and the orbital motion of all galaxies more luminous than the Fornax dwarf spheroidal, while dark halo structure is tracked consistently throughout the cluster for all galaxies more luminous than the SMC. Within its virial radius this model contains about 2Ã107 dark matter particles and almost 5000 distinct dynamically resolved galaxies. Simulations of this same cluster at a variety of resolutions allow us to check explicitly for numerical convergence both of the dark matter structures produced by our new parallel N-body and substructure identification codes, and of the galaxy populations produced by the phenomenological models we use to follow cooling, star formation, feedback and stellar aging. This baryonic modelling is tuned so that our simulations reproduce the observed properties of isolated spirals outside clusters. Without further parameter adjustment our simulations then produce a luminosity function, a mass-to-light ratio, luminosity, number and velocity dispersion profiles, and a morphology-radius relation which are similar to those observed in real clusters. In particular, since our simulations follow galaxy merging explicitly, we can demonstrate that it accounts quantitatively for the observed cluster population of bulges and elliptical galaxies.},

The evolution of the fundamental statistical properties of the models is described and their comparability with observation is discussed. Graphical comparisons of these open models with the observed galaxy distribution in a large redshift survey are made. It is concluded that a model with a cosmological density parameter omega equal to one is quite unacceptable if galaxies trace the mass distribution, and that models with omega of roughly two, while better, still do not provide a fully acceptable match with observation. Finally, a situation in which galaxy formation is suppressed except in sufficiently dense regions is modelled which leads to models which can agree with observation quite well even for omega equal to one.},

	abstract = {Deep pencil beam surveys ({\textless}1 deg2) are of fundamental importance for studying the high-redshift universe. However, inferences about galaxy population properties (e.g., the abundance of objects) are in practice limited by âcosmic variance.â This is the uncertainty in observational estimates of the number density of galaxies arising from the underlying large-scale density fluctuations. This source of uncertainty can be significant, especially for surveys which cover only small areas and for massive high-redshift galaxies. Cosmic variance for a given galaxy population can be determined using predictions from cold dark matter theory and the galaxy bias. In this paper, we provide tools for experiment design and interpretation. For a given survey geometry, we present the cosmic variance of dark matter as a function of mean redshift and redshift bin size Îz. Using a halo occupation model to predict galaxy clustering, we derive the galaxy bias as a function of mean redshift for galaxy samples of a given stellar mass range. In the linear regime, the cosmic variance of these galaxy samples is the product of the galaxy bias and the dark matter cosmic variance. We present a simple recipe using a fitting function to compute cosmic variance as a function of the angular dimensions of the field, , Îz, and stellar mass m*. We also provide tabulated values and a software tool. The accuracy of the resulting cosmic variance estimates (Î´Ïv/Ïv) is shown to be better than 20\%. We find that for GOODS at and with Îz = 0.5, the relative cosmic variance of galaxies with m*{\textgreater}1011 Mâ is â¼38\%, while it is â¼27\% for GEMS and â¼12\% for COSMOS. For galaxies of m* â¼ 1010 Mâ, the relative cosmic variance is â¼19\% for GOODS, â¼13\% for GEMS, and â¼6\% for COSMOS. This implies that cosmic variance is a significant source of uncertainty at for small fields and massive galaxies, while for larger fields and intermediate mass galaxies, cosmic variance is less serious.},

EAGLE's galaxy formation parameters were calibrated to reproduce the redshift \$z=0.1\$ galaxy stellar mass function, and the simulation also reproduces galaxy colours well. The simulation volume is too small to correctly sample large-scale fluctuations and we therefore concentrate on scales smaller than a few mega parsecs. We find very good agreement with observed clustering measurements from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey, when galaxies are binned by stellar mass, color, or luminosity. However, low-mass red-galaxies are clustered too strongly, which is at least partly due to limited numerical resolution. Apart from this limitation, we conclude that EAGLE galaxies inhabit similar dark matter haloes as observed GAMA galaxies, and that the radial distribution of satellite galaxies as function of stellar mass and colour is similar to that observed as well.},

"red and dead" massive galaxies in the first 2 Gyr after the Big Bang, integrating and updating the work on GOODS-South presented in our previous paper. We perform SED-fitting on photometric data, with top-hat star-formation histories to model an early and abrupt quenching, and using a probabilistic approach to select only robust candidates. Using libraries without (with) spectral lines emission, starting from a total of more than 20,000 \$z{\textgreater}3\$ sources we end up with 102 (40) candidates, including one at \$z=6.7\$. This implies a minimal number density of \$1.73 \pm 0.17 \times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-5\}\$ (\$6.69 \pm 1.08 \times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-6\}\$) Mpc\${\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$ for \$3{\textless}z{\textless}5\$; applying a correction factor to account for incompleteness yields \$2.30 \pm 0.20 \times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-5\}\$. We compare these values with those from five recent hydrodynamical cosmological simulations, finding a reasonable agreement at \$z{\textless}4\$; tensions arise at earlier epochs. Finally, we use the star-formation histories from the best-fit models to estimate the contribution of the high-redshift passive galaxies to the global Star Formation Rate Density during their phase of activity, finding that they account for \$\sim5-10\\%\$ of the total star formation at \$3{\textless}z{\textless}8\$, despite being only \$\sim0.5\\%\$ of the total in number. The resulting picture is that early and strong star formation activity, building massive galaxies on short timescales and followed by a quick and abrupt quenching, is a rare but crucial phenomenon in the early Universe: the evolution of the cosmos must be heavily influenced by the short but powerful activity of these pristine monsters.},

We study how analysis methodologies and observational effects impact this comparison. This includes measurement choices -- aperture, quenched definition, star formation rate (SFR) indicator timescale -- as well as observational uncertainties and sample selection issues: projection effects, satellite/central misclassification, and host mass distribution sampling. The definition used to separate quenched and star-forming galaxies produces differences of up to 70 (30)\$\\%\$ for centrals (satellites) \${\textgreater}\sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{10.5\} M\_\{\odot\}\$. Increasing the aperture within which SFR is measured can suppress the quenched fractions by up to \$\sim50\\%\$, particularly at \$z\gtrsim2\$. Proper consideration of the stellar and host mass distributions is crucial: naive comparisons to volume-limited samples from simulations lead to misinterpretation of the quenched fractions as a function of \$z\$ by up to 20\$\\%\$. Including observational uncertainties to theoretical values of \$M\_*\$ and SFR changes the quenched fraction values and their trend and/or slope with mass. Taking projected rather than 3D distances for satellites decreases the quenched fractions by up to 10\$\\%\$ due to field contamination. Comparing with data, TNG produces quenched fractions broadly consistent with observations. TNG predicts quenched fractions up to \$\sim80-90\\%\$ for centrals at \$z\leq2-3\$, in line with recent observations, and notably higher than other theoretical models. The quantitative agreement of TNG and SDSS for satellite quenched fractions in groups and clusters depends strongly on the galaxy and host mass range. Our mock comparison between TNG and SDSS highlights the importance of properly accounting for observational effects and biases.},

In this Letter, we use the EAGLE simulation to investigate the correlation of galaxy size with halo properties. We motivate this analysis by noting that the common assumption of angular momentum partition between baryons and dark matter in rotationally supported galaxies overpredicts both the spread in the stellar massâsize relation and the anticorrelation of size and velocity residuals, indicating a problem with the galaxyâhalo connection it implies. We find the EAGLE galaxy population to perform significantly better on both statistics, and trace this success to the weakness of the correlations of galaxy size with halo mass, concentration and spin at fixed stellar mass. Using these correlations in empirical models will enable fine-grained aspects of galaxy scalings to be matched.},

	abstract = {Luminous matter produces very energetic events, such as active galactic nuclei and supernova explosions, that significantly affect the internal regions of galaxy clusters. Although the current uncertainty in the effect of baryonic physics on cluster statistics is subdominant as compared to other systematics, the picture is likely to change soon as the amount of high-quality data is growing fast, urging the community to keep theoretical systematic uncertainties below the ever-growing statistical precision. In this paper, we study the effect of baryons on galaxy clusters, and their impact on the cosmological applications of clusters, using the Magneticum suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We show that the impact of baryons on the halo mass function can be recast in terms on a variation of the mass of the halos simulated with pure N-body, when baryonic effects are included. The halo mass function and halo bias are only indirectly affected. Finally, we demonstrate that neglecting baryonic effects on halos mass function and bias would significantly alter the inference of cosmological parameters from high-sensitivity next-generations surveys of galaxy clusters.},

We explore the impact of baryons, propose an improved parametrization for spherical overdensity masses, and identify differences between our DMonly HMF and previously published HMFs. We use the Magneticum simulations, which are well suited because of their accurate treatment of baryons, high resolution, and large cosmological volumes of up to (3818 Mpc)3. Baryonic effects globally decrease the masses of galaxy clusters, which, at a given mass, results in a decrease of their number density. This effect vanishes at high redshift z â¼ 2 and for high masses M200 m â³ 1014 Mâ. We perform cosmological analyses of three idealized approximations to the cluster surveys by the South Pole Telescope (SPT), Planck, and eROSITA. We pursue two main questions. (1) What is the impact of baryons? - for the SPT-like and the Planck-like samples, the impact of baryons on cosmological results is negligible. In the eROSITA-like case, however, neglecting the baryonic impact leads to an underestimate of Î©m by about 0.01, which is comparable to the expected uncertainty from eROSITA. (2) How does our DMonly HMF compare with previous work? - for the Planck-like sample, results obtained using our DMonly HMF are shifted by Î(Ï8) â Î(Ï8(Î©m/0.27)0.3) â 0.02 with respect to results obtained using the Tinker et al. fit. This suggests that using our HMF would shift results from Planck clusters towards better agreement with cosmic-microwave-background anisotropy measurements. Finally, we discuss biases that can be introduced through inadequate HMF parametrizations that introduce false cosmological sensitivity.},

This is the first paper in a series where we describe our strategy for addressing the various technical challenges in the production of weak lensing measurements from the COSMOS data. The COSMOS ACS catalog is constructed from 575 ACS/WFC tiles (1.64 deg{\textasciicircum}2) and contains a total 1.2x10{\textasciicircum}6 objects to a limiting magnitude of F814W=26.5. This catalog is made publicly available. The shapes of galaxies have been measured and corrected for the distortion induced by the time varying ACS Point Spread Function and for Charge Transfer Efficiency effects. Next, simulated images are used to derive the shear susceptibility factors that are necessary in order to transform shape measurements into unbiased shear estimators. Finally, for each galaxy, we derive a shape measurement error and utilize this quantity to extract the intrinsic shape noise of the galaxy sample. Interestingly, our results indicate that the intrinsic shape noise varies little with either size, magnitude or redshift. Representing a number density of 66 galaxies per arcmin{\textasciicircum}2, the final COSMOS weak lensing catalog contains 3.9x10{\textasciicircum}5 galaxies with accurate shape measurements. The properties of the COSMOS weak lensing catalog described throughout this paper will provide key input numbers for the preparation and design of next-generation wide field space missions.},

We find that all cosmological models fail to match our results if a constant mass-to-light ratio is assumed. In order for these models to match the faint end of the luminosity function, a mass-to-light ratio decreasing with luminosity as L-0.5+/-0.06 is required. For a ÎCDM model, the mass-to-light function has a minimum of {\textasciitilde}100 h-175 in solar units in the B band, corresponding to {\textasciitilde}25\% of the baryons in the form of stars, and this minimum occurs close to the luminosity of an L* galaxy. At the high-mass end, the ÎCDM model requires a mass-to-light ratio increasing with luminosity as L+0.5+/-0.26. This scaling behavior of the mass-to-light ratio seems to be in qualitative agreement with the predictions of semianalytical models of galaxy formation. In contrast, for the ÏCDM model, a constant mass-to-light ratio suffices to match the high-mass end. We also derive the halo occupation number, i.e., the number of galaxies brighter than L*gal hosted in a virialized system. We find that the halo occupation number scales nonlinearly with the total mass of the system, Ngal({\textgreater}L*gal){\textasciitilde}M0.55+/- 0.026 for the ÎCDM model. We find a break in the power-law slope of the X-ray-to-optical luminosity relation, independent of the cosmological model. This break occurs at a scale corresponding to poor groups. In the ÎCDM model, the poor-group mass is also the scale at which the mass-to-light ratio of virialized systems begins to increase. This correspondence suggests a physical link between star formation and the X-ray properties of halos, possibly due to preheating by supernovae or to efficient cooling of low-entropy gas into galaxies.},

At z{\textgreater}4, galaxy stellar mass functions place lower limits on halo number densities that approach expected \$\Lambda\$CDM halo mass functions. High-redshift galaxy stellar mass functions can thus place interesting limits on number densities of massive haloes, which are otherwise very difficult to measure. Although halo mass functions at z{\textless}8 are consistent with observed galaxy stellar masses if galaxy baryonic conversion efficiencies increase with redshift, JWST and WFIRST will more than double the redshift range over which useful constraints are available. We calculate maximum galaxy stellar masses as a function of redshift given expected halo number densities from \$\Lambda\$CDM. We apply similar arguments to black holes. If their virial mass estimates are accurate, number density constraints alone suggest that the quasars SDSS J1044-0125 and SDSS J010013.02+280225.8 likely have black hole mass -- stellar mass ratios higher than the median z=0 relation, confirming the expectation from Lauer bias. Finally, we present a public code to evaluate the probability of an apparently \$\Lambda\$CDM-inconsistent high-mass halo being detected given the combined effects of multiple surveys and observational errors.},

	abstract = {Numerical simulations have become a major tool for understanding galaxy formation and evolution. Over the decades the field has made significant progress. It is now possible to simulate the formation of individual galaxies and galaxy populations from well defined initial conditions with realistic abundances and global properties. An essential component of the calculation is to correctly estimate the inflow to and outflow from forming galaxies since observations indicating low formation efficiency and strong circum-glactic presence of gas are persuasive. Energetic 'feedback' from massive stars and accreting super-massive black holes - generally unresolved in cosmological simulations - plays a major role for driving galactic outflows, which have been shown to regulate many aspects of galaxy evolution. A surprisingly large variety of plausible sub-resolution models succeeds in this exercise. They capture the essential characteristics of the problem, i.e. outflows regulating galactic gas flows, but their predictive power is limited. In this review we focus on one major challenge for galaxy formation theory: to understand the underlying physical processes that regulate the structure of the interstellar medium, star formation and the driving of galactic outflows. This requires accurate physical models and numerical simulations, which can precisely describe the multi-phase structure of the interstellar medium on the currently unresolved few hundred parsecs scales of large scale cosmological simulations. Such models ultimately require the full accounting for the dominant cooling and heating processes, the radiation and winds from massive stars and accreting black holes, an accurate treatment of supernova explosions as well as the non-thermal components of the interstellar medium like magnetic fields and cosmic rays.},

	abstract = {We extend the phenomenological study of the evolving galaxy population of Peng et al. (2010) to the central/satellite dichotomy in Yang et al. Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) groups. We find that satellite galaxies are responsible for all the environmental effects in our earlier work. The fraction of centrals that are red does not depend on their environment but only on their stellar masses, whereas that of the satellites depends on both. We define a relative satellite quenching efficiency Îµsat, which is the fraction of blue centrals that are quenched upon becoming the satellite of another galaxy. This is shown to be independent of stellar mass, but to depend strongly on local overdensity, Î´, ranging between 0.2 and at least 0.8. The red fraction of satellites correlate much better with the local overdensity Î´, a measure of location within the group, than with the richness of the group, i.e., dark matter halo mass. This, and the fact that satellite quenching depends on local density and not on either the stellar mass of the galaxy or the dark matter halo mass, gives clues as to the nature of the satellite-quenching process. We furthermore show that the action of mass quenching on satellite galaxies is also independent of the dark matter mass of the parent halo. We then apply the Peng et al. approach to predict the mass functions of central and satellite galaxies, split into passive and active galaxies, and show that these match very well the observed mass functions from SDSS, further strengthening the validity of this phenomenological approach. We highlight the fact that the observed M* is exactly the same for the star-forming centrals and satellites and the observed M* for the star-forming satellites is independent of halo mass above 1012 Mâ, which emphasizes the universality of the mass-quenching process that we identified in Peng et al. Post-quenching merging modifies the mass function of the central galaxies but can increase the mass of typical centrals by only about 25\%.},

	abstract = {We present improved estimates of several global properties of the Milky Way, including its current star formation rate (SFR), the stellar mass contained in its disk and bulge+bar components, as well as its total stellar mass. We do so by combining previous measurements from the literature using a hierarchical Bayesian (HB) statistical method that allows us to account for the possibility that any value may be incorrect or have underestimated errors. We show that this method is robust to a wide variety of assumptions about the nature of problems in individual measurements or error estimates. Ultimately, our analysis yields a SFR for the Galaxy of \$\dot\{\mathrm\{M\}\}\_\star=1.65\pm0.19\$ \$\textrm\{M\}\_\odot \textrm\{yr\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, assuming a Kroupa initial mass function (IMF). By combining HB methods with Monte Carlo simulations that incorporate the latest estimates of the Galactocentric radius of the Sun, \$R\_0\$, the exponential scale length of the disk, \$L\_d\$, and the local surface density of stellar mass, \$\Sigma\_\star(R\_0)\$, we show that the mass of the Galactic bulge+bar is \$\textrm\{M\}\_\star{\textasciicircum}B=0.91\pm0.07\times10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}\$ \$\textrm\{M\}\_\odot\$, the disk mass is \$\textrm\{M\}\_\star{\textasciicircum}D=5.17\pm1.11\times10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}\$ \$\textrm\{M\}\_\odot\$, and their combination yields a total stellar mass of \$\textrm\{M\}\_\star=6.08\pm1.14\times10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}\$ \$\textrm\{M\}\_\odot\$ (assuming a Kroupa IMF and an exponential disk profile). This analysis is based upon a new compilation of literature bulge mass estimates, normalized to common assumptions about the stellar initial mass function and Galactic disk properties, presented herein. We additionally find a bulge-to-total mass ratio for the Milky Way of \$B/T=0.150{\textasciicircum}\{+0.028\}\_\{-0.019\}\$ and a specific star formation rate of \$\dot\{\mathrm\{M\}\}\_\star/\textrm\{M\}\_\star=2.71\pm0.59\times10{\textasciicircum}\{-11\} \textrm\{yr\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$.},

The second Gaia data release (DR2) contained a catalogue of absolute proper motions (PMs) for a set of Galactic GCs and satellite galaxies measured using Gaia DR2 data. We select from the catalogue only halo GCs, identifying a total of 34 GCs spanning \$2.0 {\textless} r {\textless} 21.1\$ kpc, and use their 3D kinematics to estimate the anisotropy over this range to be \$\beta = 0.46{\textasciicircum}\{+0.15\}\_\{-0.19\}\$, in good agreement, though slightly lower than, a recent estimate for a sample of halo GCs using HST PM measurements further out in the halo. We then use the Gaia kinematics to estimate the mass of the MW inside the outermost GC to be \$M({\textless} 21.1 \mathrm\{kpc\}) = 0.21{\textasciicircum}\{+0.04\}\_\{-0.03\} 10{\textasciicircum}\{12\} \mathrm\{M\_\odot\}\$, which corresponds to a circular velocity of \$v\_\mathrm\{circ\}(21.1 \mathrm\{kpc\}) = 206{\textasciicircum}\{+19\}\_\{-16\}\$ km/s. The implied virial mass is \$M\_\mathrm\{virial\} = 1.28{\textasciicircum}\{+0.97\}\_\{-0.48\} 10{\textasciicircum}\{12\} \mathrm\{M\_\odot\}\$. The error bars encompass the uncertainties on the anisotropy and on the density profile of the MW dark halo, and the scatter inherent in the mass estimator we use. We get improved estimates when we combine the Gaia and HST samples to provide kinematics for 46 GCs out to 39.5 kpc: \$\beta = 0.52{\textasciicircum}\{+0.11\}\_\{-0.14\}\$, \$M({\textless} 39.5 \mathrm\{kpc\}) = 0.42{\textasciicircum}\{+0.07\}\_\{-0.06\} 10{\textasciicircum}\{12\} \mathrm\{M\_\odot\}\$, and \$M\_\mathrm\{virial\} = 1.54{\textasciicircum}\{+0.75\}\_\{-0.44\} 10{\textasciicircum}\{12\} \mathrm\{M\_\odot\}\$. We show that these results are robust to potential substructure in the halo GC distribution. While a wide range of MW virial masses have been advocated in the literature, from below \$10{\textasciicircum}\{12\} \mathrm\{M\_\odot\}\$ to above \$2 \times 10{\textasciicircum}\{12\}\mathrm\{M\_\odot\}\$, these new data imply that an intermediate mass is most likely.},

The observed luminosity-radius-metallicity relations are found to be produced naturally inside dominant halos, with a mass-radius relation that resembles the predictions of the "cold" dark matter cosmological scenario. The critical condition for global gas loss as a result of the first burst of star formation is that the virial velocity be below a critical value on the order of 100 km s-1. In any hierarchial scenario for galaxy formation, this condition leads to two distinct classes of galaxies as observed: (1) the diffuse dwarfs which mostly originate from typical density perturbations; and (2) the normal, brighter galaxies which can originate only from the highest density peaks. This provides a statistical biasing mechanism for the preferential formation of bright galaxies in denser regions (clusters and superclusters).},

Simulations with only supernova feedback fail to reproduce observed stellar masses, particularly in dwarf and high-redshift galaxies: radiative feedback (photoheating and radiation pressure) is necessary to destroy giant molecular clouds and enable efficient coupling of later supernovae to the gas. Star formation rates (SFRs) agree well with the observed Kennicutt relation at all redshifts. The galaxy-averaged Kennicutt relation is very different from the numerically imposed law for converting gas into stars, and is determined by self-regulation via stellar feedback. Feedback reduces SFRs and produces reservoirs of gas that lead to rising late-time star formation histories, significantly different from halo accretion histories. Feedback also produces large short-time-scale variability in galactic SFRs, especially in dwarfs. These properties are not captured by common `sub-grid' wind models.},

	abstract = {To better understand the impact of supernova (SN) explosions on the evolution of galaxies, we perform a suite of high-resolution (12 pc), zoom-in cosmological simulations of a Milky Way-like galaxy at z = 3 with adaptive mesh refinement. We find that SN explosions can efficiently regulate star formation, leading to the stellar mass and metallicity consistent with the observed mass-metallicity relation and stellar mass-halo mass relation at z â¼ 3. This is achieved by making three important changes to the classical feedback scheme: (i) the different phases of SN blast waves are modelled directly by injecting radial momentum expected at each stage, (ii) the realistic time delay of SNe is required to disperse very dense gas before a runaway collapse sets in, and (iii) a non-uniform density distribution of the interstellar medium (ISM) is taken into account below the computational grid scale for the cell in which an SN explodes. The simulated galaxy with the SN feedback model shows strong outflows, which carry approximately 10 times larger mass than star formation rate, as well as smoothly rising circular velocity. Although the metallicity of the outflow depends sensitively on the feedback model used, we find that the accretion rate and metallicity of the cold flow around the virial radius is impervious to SN feedback. Our results suggest that understanding the structure of the turbulent ISM may be crucial to assess the role of SN and other feedback processes in galaxy formation theory.},

	abstract = {We present the first implementation of active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback in the form of momentum-driven jets in an adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) cosmological resimulation of a galaxy cluster. The jets are powered by gas accretion on to supermassive black holes (SMBHs) which also grow by mergers. Throughout its formation, the cluster experiences different dynamical states: both a morphologically perturbed epoch at early times and a relaxed state at late times allowing us to study the different modes of black hole (BH) growth and associated AGN jet feedback. BHs accrete gas efficiently at high redshift (z {\textgreater} 2), significantly pre-heating proto-cluster haloes. Gas-rich mergers at high redshift also fuel strong, episodic jet activity, which transports gas from the proto-cluster core to its outer regions. At later times, while the cluster relaxes, the supply of cold gas on to the BHs is reduced leading to lower jet activity. Although the cluster is still heated by this activity as sound waves propagate from the core to the virial radius, the jets inefficiently redistribute gas outwards and a small cooling flow develops, along with low-pressure cavities similar to those detected in X-ray observations. Overall, our jet implementation of AGN feedback quenches star formation quite efficiently, reducing the stellar content of the central cluster galaxy by a factor of 3 compared to the no-AGN case. It also dramatically alters the shape of the gas density profile, bringing it in close agreement with the Î² model favoured by observations, producing quite an isothermal galaxy cluster for gigayears in the process. However, it still falls short in matching the lower than universal baryon fractions which seem to be commonplace in observed galaxy clusters.},

	abstract = {In this work we want to study the average mass density profile of tens to hundreds of clusters of galaxies acting as lenses that produce a magnification bias on the SMGs, and to estimate their associated masses and concentrations for different richness ranges. The background sample is composed of SMGs observed by Herschel with 1.2{\textless}z{\textless}4.0 (mean redshift at {\textasciitilde}2.3) while the foreground sample is made up of galaxy clusters extracted from the SDSS III with photometric redshifts of 0.05{\textless} z{\textless} 0.8 (mean redshift at {\textasciitilde}0.38). Measurements are obtained by stacking the SMG--cluster pairs to estimate the cross-correlation function using the Davis-Peebles estimator. This methodology allows us to derive the mass density profile for a wide range of angular scales, {\textasciitilde}2-250 arcsec or {\textasciitilde}10-1300 kpc for z=0.38, with a high radial resolution. We find that It is impossible to fit the data with a single mass density profile at all scales. As for the outer part, the estimated average masses increase from \$M\_\{200c\}=5.8\$ to \$51.5\times 10{\textasciicircum}\{13\} M\_\odot\$ and the concentration parameter from C=0.74 to 1.74. In the small-scale regions, the obtained average masses fluctuate around \$M\_\{200c\}=3-4 \times 10{\textasciicircum}\{13\}M\_\odot\$ with average C{\textasciitilde}4. The total average masses are in perfect agreement with the M-R relationship estimated from the cluster catalogue. While the estimated average C values of the central galactic halos are in agreement with traditional M-C relationships, we find low concentrations for the outer part. Moreover, C decrease for lower R values, probably indicating that the group of galaxies cannot be considered to be relaxed systems. Finally, we notice a systematic lack of signal at the transition between the dominance of the cluster halo and the central galactic halo ({\textasciitilde}100 kpc). This feature is also present in previous studies using different catalogues and/or methodologies, but is never discussed.},

	abstract = {We report the first detection of a redshift-depth enhancement of background galaxies magnified by foreground clusters. Using 300,000 BOSS-Survey galaxies with accurate spectroscopic redshifts, we measure their mean redshift depth behind four large samples of optically selected clusters from the SDSS surveys, totalling 5,000-15,000 clusters. A clear trend of increasing mean redshift towards the cluster centers is found, averaged over each of the four cluster samples. In addition we find similar but noisier behaviour for an independent X-ray sample of 158 clusters lying in the foreground of the current BOSS sky area. By adopting the mass-richness relationships appropriate for each survey we compare our results with theoretical predictions for each of the four SDSS cluster catalogs. The radial form of this redshift enhancement is well fitted by a richness-to-mass weighted composite Navarro-Frenk-White profile with an effective mass ranging between M\_200 {\textasciitilde} 1.4-1.8 10{\textasciicircum}14 M\_sun for the optically detected cluster samples, and M\_200 {\textasciitilde} 5.0 10{\textasciicircum}14 M\_sun for the X-ray sample. This lensing detection helps to establish the credibility of these SDSS cluster surveys, and provides a normalization for their respective mass-richness relations. In the context of the upcoming bigBOSS, Subaru-PFS, and EUCLID-NISP spectroscopic surveys, this method represents an independent means of deriving the masses of cluster samples for examining the cosmological evolution, and provides a relatively clean consistency check of weak-lensing measurements, free from the systematic limitations of shear calibration.},

While more than 20 proto-clusters have been observed at zâ³ 2 based on associations of 5-40 galaxies around rare sources, the observational evidence for rapid cluster formation is weak. Here we report observations of an asymmetric filamentary structure at z = 2.47 containing 7 starbursting, submillimeter-luminous galaxies and 5 additional active galactic nuclei (AGNs) within a comoving volume of 15,000 Mpc3. As the expected lifetime of both the luminous AGN and starburst phase of a galaxy is â¼100 Myr, we conclude that these sources were likely triggered in rapid succession by environmental factors or, alternatively, the duration of these cosmologically rare phenomena is much longer than prior direct measurements suggest. The stellar mass already built up in the structure is â¼1012 \{M\}â and we estimate that the cluster mass will exceed that of the Coma supercluster at zâ¼ 0.

Our finding of this DSFG-rich structure, along with a number of other protoclusters with excess DSFGs and AGNs found to date, suggest that the overdensities of these rare sources indeed trace significant mass overdensities. However, it remains puzzling how these intense star formers are triggered concurrently. Although an increased probability of galaxy interactions and/or enhanced gas supply can trigger the excess of DSFGs, our stacking analysis based on 850 Î¼m images and morphological analysis based on rest-frame optical imaging do not show such enhancements of merger fraction and gas content in this structure.},

Converting these ratios into metallicities, we find that the cluster SFGs are up to 0.25 dex poorer in metals than their field counterparts, depending on the adopted calibration. The low metallicity in cluster sources is confirmed using alternative indicators. Furthermore, we observe a significantly higher HÎ± luminosity and equivalent width in the average cluster spectrum than in the field. This is likely due to the enhanced specific star formation rate; even if lower dust reddening and/or an uncertain environmental dependence on the continuum-to-nebular emission differential reddening may play a role. Our findings might be explained by the accretion of pristine gas around galaxies at z = 2 and from cluster-scale reservoirs, possibly connected with a phase of rapid halo mass assembly at z {\textgreater} 2 and of a high galaxy merging rate.},

	abstract = {There is a lack of large samples of spectroscopically confirmed clusters and protoclusters at high redshifts, \$z{\textgreater}\$1.5. Discovering and characterizing distant (proto-)clusters is important for yielding insights into the formation of large-scale structure and on the physical processes responsible for regulating star-formation in galaxies in dense environments. The Spitzer Planck Herschel Infrared Cluster (SPHerIC) survey was initiated to identify these characteristically faint and dust-reddened sources during the epoch of their early assembly. We present Spitzer IRAC observations of 82 galaxy (proto-)cluster candidates at 1.3{\textless}\$z\_p\${\textless}3.0 that were vetted in a two step process: (1) using Planck to select by color those sources with the highest star-formation rates, and (2) using Herschel at higher resolution to separate out the individual red sources. The addition of the Spitzer data enables efficient detection of the central and massive brightest red cluster galaxies (BRCGs). We find that BRCGs are associated with highly significant, extended and crowded regions of IRAC sources which are more overdense than the field. This result corroborates our hypothesis that BRCGs within the Planck - Herschel sources trace some of the densest and actively star-forming proto-clusters in the early Universe. On the basis of a richness-mass proxy relation, we obtain an estimate of their mean masses which suggests our sample consists of some of the most massive clusters at z\$\approx\$2 and are the likely progenitors of the most massive clusters observed today.},

	abstract = {The potential for Planck to detect clusters of dusty, star-forming galaxies at z greater than 1 is tested by examining the Herschel-SPIRE images of Planck Early Release Compact Source Catalog (ERCSC) sources lying in fields observed by the HerMES survey. Of the 16 Planck sources that lie in the roughly 90 sq. deg. examined, we find that twelve are associated with single bright Herschel sources. The remaining four are associated with overdensities of Herschel sources, making them candidate clusters of dusty, starforming galaxies. We use complementary optical and NIR data for these clumps to test this idea, and find evidence for the presence of galaxy clusters in all four cases. We use photometric redshifts and red sequence galaxies to estimate the redshifts of these clusters, finding that they range from 0.8 to 2.3. These redshifts imply that the Herschel sources in these clusters, which contribute to the detected Planck flux, are forming stars very rapidly, with typical total cluster star formation rates greater than 1000Msun per yr. The high redshift clusters discovered in these observations are used to constrain the epoch of cluster galaxy formation, finding that the galaxies in our clusters are 1 to 1.5 Gy old at z about 1 to 2. Prospects for the discovery of further clusters of dusty galaxies are discussed, using not only all sky Planck surveys, but also deeper, smaller area, Herschel surveys.},

These data, obtained for 387 fields, reach 3.6 and 4.5 um depths of [3.6] (AB) = 22.6 and [4.5] (AB) = 22.9 at the 95\% completeness level, which is two to three times fainter than L* in this redshift range. By using the color cut [3.6]-[4.5] {\textgreater} -0.1 (AB), which efficiently selects high-redshift (z {\textgreater} 1.3) galaxies of all types, we identify galaxy cluster member candidates in the fields of the radio-loud AGN. The local density of these IRAC-selected sources is compared to the density of similarly selected sources in blank fields. We find that 92\% of the radio-loud AGN reside in environments richer than average. The majority (55\%) of the radio-loud AGN fields are found to be overdense at a {\textgreater} 2 \{\sigma\} level; 10\% are overdense at a {\textgreater} 5 \{\sigma\} level. A clear rise in surface density of IRAC-selected sources towards the position of the radio-loud AGN strongly supports an association of the majority of the IRAC-selected sources with the radio-loud AGN. Our results provide solid statistical evidence that radio-loud AGN are likely beacons for finding high-redshift galaxy (proto-)clusters. We investigate how environment depends on AGN type (unobscured radio-loud quasars vs. obscured radio galaxies), radio luminosity and redshift, finding no correlation with either AGN type or radio luminosity. We find a decrease in density with redshift, consistent with galaxy evolution for this uniform, flux-limited survey. These results are consistent with expectations from the orientation-driven AGN unification model, at least for the high radio luminosity regimes considered in this sample.},

	abstract = {We investigate the conditions for the existence of an expanding virial shock in the gas falling within a spherical dark matter halo. The shock relies on pressure support by the shock-heated gas behind it. When the radiative cooling is efficient compared with the infall rate, the post-shock gas becomes unstable; it collapses inwards and cannot support the shock. We find for a monatomic gas that the shock is stable when the post-shock pressure and density obey . When expressed in terms of the pre-shock gas properties at radius r it reads as ÏrÎ(T)/u3 {\textless} 0.0126, where Ï is the gas density, u is the infall velocity and Î(T) is the cooling function, with the post-shock temperature T{\textasciitilde}u2. This result is confirmed by hydrodynamical simulations, using an accurate spheri-symmetric Lagrangian code. When the stability analysis is applied in cosmology, we find that a virial shock does not develop in most haloes that form before z{\textasciitilde} 2, and it never forms in haloes less massive than a few 1011 Msolar. In such haloes, the infalling gas is not heated to the virial temperature until it hits the disc, thus avoiding the cooling-dominated quasi-static contraction phase. The direct collapse of the cold gas into the disc should have non-trivial effects on the star formation rate and on outflows. The soft X-ray produced by the shock-heated gas in the disc is expected to ionize the dense disc environment, and the subsequent recombination would result in a high flux of LÎ± emission. This may explain both the puzzling low flux of soft X-ray background and the LÎ± emitters observed at high redshift.},

	abstract = {The massive galaxies in the young universe, ten billion years ago, formed stars at surprising intensities. Although this is commonly attributed to violent mergers, the properties of many of these galaxies are incompatible with such events, showing gas-rich, clumpy, extended rotating disks not dominated by spheroids (Genzel et al. 2006, 2008). Cosmological simulations and clustering theory are used to explore how these galaxies acquired their gas. Here we report that they are stream-fed galaxies, formed from steady, narrow, cold gas streams that penetrate the shock-heated media of massive dark matter haloes (Dekel \& Birnboim 2006; Keres et al. 2005). A comparison with the observed abundance of star-forming galaxies implies that most of the input gas must rapidly convert to stars. One-third of the stream mass is in gas clumps leading to mergers of mass ratio greater than 1:10, and the rest is in smoother flows. With a merger duy cycle of 0.1, three-quarters of the galaxies forming stars at a given rate are fed by smooth streams. The rarer, submillimetre galaxies that form stars even more intensely are largely merger-induced starbursts. Unlike destructive mergers, the streams are likely to keep the rotating disk configuration intact, although turbulent and broken into giant star-forming clumps that merge into a central spheroid (Noguchi 1999; Genzel et al. 2008, Elmegreen, Bournaud \& Elmegreen 2008, Dekel, Sari \& Ceverino 2009). This stream-driven scenario for the formation of disks and spheroids is an alternative to the merger picture.},

	abstract = {We address the origin of the robust bimodality observed in galaxy properties about a characteristic stellar mass â¼3 Ã 1010 M . Less massive galaxies tend to be ungrouped blue star forming discs, while more massive galaxies are typically grouped red old-star spheroids. Colourâmagnitude data show a gap between the red and blue sequences, extremely red luminous galaxies already at z â¼ 1, a truncation of todayâs blue sequence above Lâ, and massive starbursts at z â¼ 2â4. We propose that these features are driven by the thermal properties of the inï¬owing gas and their interplay with the clustering and feedback processes, all functions of the dark matter halo mass and associated with a similar characteristic scale. In haloes below a critical shock-heating mass M shock 1012 M , discs are built by cold streams, not heated by a virial shock, yielding efï¬cient early star formation. It is regulated by supernova feedback into a long sequence of bursts in blue galaxies constrained to a âfundamental lineâ. Cold streams penetrating through hot media in M M shock haloes preferentially at z 2 lead to massive starbursts in L {\textgreater} Lâ galaxies. At z {\textless} 2, in M {\textgreater} M shock haloes hosting groups, the gas is heated by a virial shock, and being dilute it becomes vulnerable to feedback from energetic sources such as active galactic nuclei. This shuts off gas supply and prevents further star formation, leading by passive evolution to âred-and-deadâ massive spheroids starting at z â¼ 1. A minimum in feedback efï¬ciency near Mshock explains the observed minimum in M/L and the qualitative features of the star formation history. The cold ï¬ows provide a hint for solving the angular momentum problem. When these processes are incorporated in simulations they recover the main bimodality features and solve other open puzzles.},

	abstract = {The Planck satellite has identified more than 2000 protocluster candidates with extreme star formation rates (SFRs). Here, we present the spectroscopic identification of a Planck-selected protocluster located in the Cosmos field, PHz G237.01+42.50 (G237). G237 contains a galaxy overdensity of 31 spectroscopically identified galaxies at z{\textasciitilde}2.16 (significant at 5.4 sigma) in a 10'x11' region. The overdensity contains two substructures or protoclusters at {\textless}z{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}2.16 and 2.195 with estimated halo masses at z=0 of {\textasciitilde}(5-6)x10{\textasciicircum}14 Msun. The overdensity total SFR, {\textasciitilde}4000 Msun/yr, is higher than predicted by simulations but much smaller than the SFR derived from the Planck data. The analysis of the Herschel data, in combination with the available ancillary data, shows that such a difference is due to an effect of source alignment along the line of sight that produces a 5 sigma overdensity of red Herschel sources in the field. We analyze the members' UV spectra and UV-far-infrared spectral energy distributions to derive their SFR, stellar mass, and metallicity. Galaxy members include blue star-forming galaxies and AGN with SFRs and stellar masses consistent with the main sequence. AGN, identified through optical spectroscopy or X-ray data, represent a significant fraction (20+/-10\%) of all members of the protocluster at z=2.16, and they are powerful enough to produce radiative feedback. The core of this protocluster, besides being denser, includes members that are, on average, more massive and star-forming and contains a larger fraction of AGN and Herschel-detected galaxies than the full sample, suggesting an environmental effect on galaxy growth. A comparison between G237 and other protoclusters in the literature at similar redshifts reveals some common traits and differences that reflect both observational biases and a diversity in intrinsic properties that is not yet fully understood.},

We have combined these new observations with all relevant IRAC archival data of these fields in order to produce the deepest possible mosaics of these regions. In total, these observations represent nearly 11\% of the total Spitzer mission time. The resulting mosaics cover a total of approximately 71.5deg\${\textasciicircum}2\$ in the 3.6 and 4.5um bands, and approximately 21.8deg\${\textasciicircum}2\$ in the 5.8 and 8um bands. They reach at least 24 AB magnitude (measured to sigma, in a 2.5 arcsec aperture) in the 3.6um band and up to {\textasciitilde} 5 mag deeper in the deepest regions. The astrometry is tied to the Gaia astrometric reference system, and the typical astrometric uncertainty for sources with 16{\textless}[3.6]{\textless}19 is {\textless}0.15 arcsec. The photometric calibration is in excellent agreement with previous WISE measurements. We have extracted source number counts from the 3.6um band mosaics and they are in excellent agreement with previous measurements. Given that the Spitzer Space Telescope has now been decommissioned these mosaics are likely to be the definitive reduction of these IRAC data. This survey therefore represents an essential first step in assembling multi-wavelength data on the Euclid deep fields which are set to become some of the premier fields for extragalactic astronomy in the 2020s.},

We measure reddening as the difference between the measured and predicted colors of a star, as derived from stellar parameters from the Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration Stellar Parameter Pipeline. We achieve uncertainties of 56, 34, 25, and 29 mmag in the colors u - g, g - r, r - i, and i - z, per star, though the uncertainty varies depending on the stellar type and the magnitude of the star. The spectrum-based reddening measurements confirm our earlier "blue tip" reddening measurements, finding reddening coefficients different by -3\%, 1\%, 1\%, and 2\% in u - g, g - r, r - i, and i - z from those found by the blue tip method, after removing a 4\% normalization difference. These results prefer an RV = 3.1 Fitzpatrick reddening law to O'Donnell or Cardelli et al. reddening laws. We provide a table of conversion coefficients from the Schlegel et al. (SFD) maps of E(B - V) to extinction in 88 bandpasses for four values of RV , using this reddening law and the 14\% recalibration of SFD first reported by Schlafly et al. and confirmed in this work.},

	abstract = {We present the novel wide \& deep neural network GalaxyNet, which connects the properties of galaxies and dark matter haloes, and is directly trained on observed galaxy statistics using reinforcement learning. The most important halo properties to predict stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR) are halo mass, growth rate, and scale factor at the time the mass peaks, which results from a feature importance analysis with random forests. We train different models with supervised learning to find the optimal network architecture. GalaxyNet is then trained with a reinforcement learning approach: for a fixed set of weights and biases, we compute the galaxy properties for all haloes and then derive mock statistics (stellar mass functions, cosmic and specific SFRs, quenched fractions, and clustering). Comparing these statistics to observations we get the model loss, which is minimised with particle swarm optimisation. GalaxyNet reproduces the observed data very accurately (\$\chi\_\mathrm\{red\}=1.05\$), and predicts a stellar-to-halo mass relation with a lower normalisation and shallower low-mass slope at high redshift than empirical models. We find that at low mass, the galaxies with the highest SFRs are satellites, although most satellites are quenched. The normalisation of the instantaneous conversion efficiency increases with redshift, but stays constant above \$z\gtrsim0.7\$. Finally, we use GalaxyNet to populate a cosmic volume of \$(5.9{\textasciitilde}\mathrm\{Gpc\}){\textasciicircum}3\$ with galaxies and predict the BAO signal, the bias, and the clustering of active and passive galaxies up to \$z=4\$, which can be tested with next-generation surveys, such as LSST and Euclid.},

	abstract = {We examine the origin of clustercentric gradients in the star formation rates and colors of rich cluster galaxies within the context of a simple model where clusters are built through the ongoing accretion of field galaxies. The model assumes that after galaxies enter the cluster their star formation rates decline on a timescale of a few gigayears, the typical gas consumption timescale of disk galaxies in the field. Such behavior might be expected if tides and ram pressure strip off the gaseous envelopes that normally fuel star formation in spirals over a Hubble time. Combining these timescales with mass accretion histories derived from N-body simulations of cluster formation in a ÎCDM universe, we reproduce the systematic differences observed in the color distribution of cluster and field galaxies, as well as the strong suppression of star formation in cluster galaxies and its dependence on clustercentric radius. The simulations also indicate that a significant fraction of galaxies beyond the virial radius of the cluster may have been within the main body of the cluster in the past, a result that explains naturally why star formation in the outskirts of clusters (and as far out as 2 virial radii) is systematically suppressed relative to the field. The agreement with the data beyond the cluster virial radius is also improved if we assume that stripping happens within lower mass systems, before the galaxy is accreted into the main body of the cluster. We conclude that the star formation rates of cluster galaxies depend primarily on the time elapsed since their accretion onto massive virialized systems and that the cessation of star formation may have taken place gradually over a few gigayears.},

Separating the red and blue populations of satellites and hosts, using colourâmass diagrams, we investigate the radial distribution of satellite galaxies and determine how the red fraction of satellites varies as a function of satellite mass, host mass and the projected distance from their host. Comparing the red fraction of satellites to a control sample of small neighbours at greater projected radii, we show that the increase in red fraction is primarily a function of host mass. The satellite red fraction is about 0.2 higher than the control sample for hosts with , while the red fractions show no difference for hosts with . For the satellites of more massive hosts, the red fraction also increases as a function of decreasing projected distance.

Despite its cosmological nature, little h commonly appears in the measured properties of individual galaxies. This can pose unique challenges for users of such data, particularly with survey data. In this paper we show how little h arises in the measurement of galaxies, how to compare like-properties from different datasets that have assumed different little h cosmologies, and how to fairly compare theoretical data with observed data, where little h can manifest in vastly different ways. This last point is particularly important when observations are used to calibrate galaxy formation models, as calibrating with the wrong (or no) little h can lead to disastrous results when the model is later converted to the correct h cosmology. We argue that in this modern age little h is an anachronism, being one of least uncertain parameters in astrophysics, and we propose that observers and theorists instead treat this uncertainty like any other. We conclude with a "cheat sheet" of nine points that should be followed when dealing with little h in data analysis.},

MagLim / redMaGiC sample contains over 10 million / 2.5 million galaxies and is divided into six / five photometric redshift bins spanning the range \$z\in[0.20,1.05]\$ / \$z\in[0.15,0.90]\$. Both samples cover 4143 deg\${\textasciicircum}2\$ over which we perform our analysis blind, measuring the angular correlation function with a S/N \$\sim 63\$ for both samples. In a companion paper (DES Collaboration et al. 2021)), these measurements of galaxy clustering are combined with the correlation functions of cosmic shear and galaxy-galaxy lensing of each sample to place cosmological constraints with a 3\$\times\$2pt analysis. We conduct a thorough study of the mitigation of systematic effects caused by the spatially varying survey properties and we correct the measurements to remove artificial clustering signals. We employ several decontamination methods with different configurations to ensure the robustness of our corrections and to determine the systematic uncertainty that needs to be considered for the final cosmology analyses. We validate our fiducial methodology using log-normal mocks, showing that our decontamination procedure induces biases no greater than \$0.5\sigma\$ in the \$(\Omega\_m, b)\$ plane, where \$b\$ is galaxy bias. We demonstrate that failure to remove the artificial clustering would introduce strong biases up to \$\sim 7 \sigma\$ in \$\Omega\_m\$ and of more than \$4 \sigma\$ in galaxy bias.},

Our measurement of the galaxy-quasar cross-correlation function exhibits the amplitude, angular dependence, and change in sign as a function of the slope of the observed quasar number counts that is expected from magniï¬cation bias due to weak gravitational lensing.

	abstract = {Flux magnification is an interesting complement to shear-based lensing measurements, especially at high redshift where sources are harder to resolve. One measures either changes in the source density (magnification bias) or in the shape of the flux distribution (e.g. magnitude shift). The interpretation of these measurements relies on theoretical estimates of how the observables change under magnification. Here, we present simulations to create multiband photometric mock catalogues of Lyman-break galaxies in a CFHTLenS (Canada France Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey)-like survey that include several observational effects that can change these relations, making simple theoretical estimates unusable. In particular, we show how the magnification bias can be affected by photometric noise, colour selection, and dust extinction. We find that a simple measurement of the slope of the number-counts is not sufficient for the precise interpretation of virtually all observations of magnification bias. We also explore how sensitive the shift in the mean magnitude of a source sample in different photometric bands is to magnification including the same observational effects. Again we find significant deviations from simple analytical estimates. We also discover a wavelength-dependence of the magnitude-shift effect when applied to a colour-selected noisy source sample. Such an effect can mimic the reddening by dust in the lens. It has to be disentangled from the dust extinction before the magnitude shift/colour-excess can be used to measure the distribution of either dark matter or extragalactic dust. Using simulations like the ones presented here these observational effects can be studied and eventually removed from observations making precise measurements of flux magnification possible.},

	abstract = {Methods that exploit galaxy clustering to constrain the galaxyâhalo relationship, such as the halo occupation distribution (HOD) and conditional luminosity function (CLF), assume halo mass alone sufï¬ces to determine a haloâs galaxy content. Yet, halo clustering strength depends upon properties other than mass, such as formation time, an effect known as assembly bias. If galaxy characteristics are correlated with these auxiliary halo properties, the basic assumption of standard HOD/CLF methods is violated. We estimate the potential for assembly bias to induce systematic errors in inferred halo occupation statistics. We construct realistic mock galaxy catalogues that exhibit assembly bias as well as companion mock catalogues with identical HODs, but with assembly bias removed. We ï¬t HODs to the galaxy clustering in each catalogue. In the absence of assembly bias, the inferred HODs describe the true HODs well, validating the methodology. However, in all cases with assembly bias, the inferred HODs exhibit signiï¬cant systematic errors. We conclude that the galaxyâhalo relationship inferred from galaxy clustering is subject to signiï¬cant systematic errors induced by assembly bias. Efforts to model and/or constrain assembly bias should be priorities as assembly bias is a threatening source of systematic error in galaxy evolution and precision cosmology studies.},

	abstract = {The clustering of dark haloes depends not only on their mass but also on their assembly history, a dependence we term âassembly biasâ. Using a galaxy formation model grafted on to the Millennium Simulation of the CDM cosmogony, we study how assembly bias affects galaxy clustering. We compare the original simulation to âshufï¬edâ versions where the galaxy populations are randomly swapped among haloes of similar mass, thus isolating the effects of correlations between assembly history and environment at ï¬xed mass. Such correlations are ignored in the halo occupation distribution models often used populate dark matter simulations with galaxies, but they are signiï¬cant in our more realistic simulation. Assembly bias enhances two-point correlations by 10 per cent for galaxies with MbJ â 5 log h brighter than â17, but suppresses them by a similar amount for galaxies brighter than â20. When such samples are split by colour, assembly bias is 5 per cent stronger for red galaxies and 5 per cent weaker for blue ones. Halo central galaxies are differently affected by assembly bias than are galaxies of all types. It almost doubles the correlation amplitude for faint red central galaxies. Shufï¬ing galaxies among haloes of ï¬xed formation redshift or concentration in addition to ï¬xed mass produces biases which are not much smaller than when mass alone is ï¬xed. Assembly bias must reï¬ect a correlation of environment with aspects of halo assembly which are not encoded in either of these parameters. It induces effects which could compromise precision measurements of cosmological parameters from large galaxy surveys.},

	abstract = {The mass assembly history of dark matter halos, and its effects on halo structural parameters and galaxy properties are studied, using a statistical sample of halos in a high-resolution N-body simulation of the Lambda-CDM cosmology. For each redshift zero halo, we identify its merger-history tree, and determine angular momentum properties and concentration parameters cvir for all progenitors, thus providing a structural merger tree for each halo. I demonstrate that halo mass accretion histories are well fit by a universal function with one parameter, the formation epoch ac, defined when the log mass accretion rate falls below a critical value. Halo density profiles measured at an epoch aobs can be characterized by a concentration parameter, cvir, which is strongly correlated with ac via cvir=cc aobs /ac. Scatter about this relation is mostly due to measurement errors in cvir and ac, implying that the actual spread in concentrations for halos of a given mass can be primarily attributed to scatter in formation time. This relation can also be used to predict the mass and redshift dependence of cvir, and the scatter about the median cvir(M,z), using accretion histories derived from the Extended Press-Schechter (EPS) formalism. Statistics of halo merging histories are investigated, and some discrepancies with EPS are noted. The relation between the build-up and evolution of a halo's angular momentum and its merging and accretion history is described. The correlations between halo structural parameters and their mass assembly histories have important implications for galaxy formation models and observable properties of galaxies.

We use â¼100 deg2 of KiDS data to study the lensing signal around galaxies for which spectroscopic redshifts and stellar masses were determined by GAMA.

At Mâ {\textgreater} 5 Ã 1010hâ2Mâ, the stellar mass increases with halo mass as â¼Mh0.25.

Our sample consists of 29,300 galaxies with redshifts 5700kms-1{\textless}=cz{\textless}=39,000kms-1, distributed in several long but narrow (2.5d-5Â°) segments, covering 690 deg2. For the full, flux-limited sample, the redshift-space correlation length is approximately 8 h-1 Mpc. The two-dimensional correlation function Î¾(rp,Ï) shows clear signatures of both the small-scale, ``fingers-of-God'' distortion caused by velocity dispersions in collapsed objects and the large-scale compression caused by coherent flows, though the latter cannot be measured with high precision in the present sample. The inferred real-space correlation function is well described by a power law, Î¾(r)=(r/6.1+/-0.2h-1Mpc)-1.75+/-0.03, for 0.1h-1Mpc{\textless}=r{\textless}=16h-1Mpc. The galaxy pairwise velocity dispersion is Ï12{\textasciitilde}600+/-100kms-1 for projected separations 0.15h-1Mpc{\textless}=rp{\textless}=5h-1Mpc. When we divide the sample by color, the red galaxies exhibit a stronger and steeper real-space correlation function and a higher pairwise velocity dispersion than do the blue galaxies. The relative behavior of subsamples defined by high/low profile concentration or high/low surface brightness is qualitatively similar to that of the red/blue subsamples. Our most striking result is a clear measurement of scale-independent luminosity bias at r{\textless}{\textasciitilde}10h-1Mpc: subsamples with absolute magnitude ranges centered on M*-1.5, M*, and M*+1.5 have real-space correlation functions that are parallel power laws of slope {\textasciitilde}-1.8 with correlation lengths of approximately 7.4, 6.3, and 4.7 h-1 Mpc, respectively.},

	abstract = {We study galaxy clustering in the framework of halo models, where gravitational clustering is described in terms of dark matter halos. At small scales, dark matter clustering statistics are dominated by halo density profiles, whereas at large scales, correlations are the result of combining nonlinear perturbation theory with halo biasing. Galaxies are assumed to follow the dark matter profiles of the halo they inhabit, and galaxy formation efficiency is characterized by the number of galaxies that populate a halo of given mass. This approach leads to generic predictions: the galaxy power spectrum shows a power-law behavior even though the dark matter does not, and the galaxy higher order correlations show smaller amplitudes at small scales than their dark matter counterparts. Both are in qualitatively agreement with measurements in galaxy catalogs. We find that requiring the model to fit both the second- and third-order moments of the Automatic Plate Measuring Facility (APM) galaxies provides a strong constraint on galaxy formation models. The data at large scales require that galaxy formation be relatively efficient at small masses, m{\textasciitilde}1010 Msolar h-1, whereas data at smaller scales require that the number of galaxies in a halo scale approximately as the mass to the 0.8th power in the high-mass limit. These constraints are independent of those derived from the luminosity function or Tully-Fisher relation. We also predict the power spectrum, bispectrum, and higher order moments of the mass density field in this framework. Although halo models agree well with measurements of the mass power spectrum and the higher order Sp parameters in N-body simulations, the model assumption that halos are spherical leads to disagreement in the configuration dependence of the bispectrum at small scales. We stress the importance of finite-volume effects in higher order statistics and show how they can be estimated in this approach.},

	abstract = {We investigate an analytic model to compute the non-linear power spectrum of dark matter, galaxies and their cross-correlation. The model is based on Press-Schechter haloes, which cluster and have realistic dark matter profiles. The total power spectrum is a sum of two contributions, one from correlations between the haloes and one from correlations within the same halo. We show that such a model can give dark matter power spectra which match well with the results of N-body simulations, provided that the concentration parameter decreases with the halo mass. The galaxy power spectrum differs from the dark matter power spectrum because the pair-weighted number of galaxies does not scale with the halo mass and because most haloes harbour a central galaxy. If the pair-weighted number of galaxies increases less rapidly than the halo mass, as predicted by theoretical models and observed in clusters, then the resulting power spectrum becomes a power law with a slope close to the observed over several orders of magnitude in scale. Such a model also predicts a later onset of non-linear clustering in comparison with dark matter, which is needed to reconcile the cold dark matter (CDM) models with the data. A generic prediction of this model is that bias is scale-dependent and non-monotonic. This is particularly important for red or elliptical galaxies, which are preferentially found in larger mass haloes and for which the bias in the power spectrum may be scale-dependent even on large scales. Our predictions for galaxy-dark matter correlations, which can be observed through galaxy-galaxy lensing, show that these cannot be interpreted simply as an average halo profile of a typical galaxy, because different halo masses dominate at different scales and because larger haloes host more than one galaxy. We compute predictions for the cross-correlation coefficient as a function of scale and discuss the prospects of using cross-correlations in combination with galaxy clustering to determine the dark matter power spectrum.},

	abstract = {We use high-resolution, dissipationless simulations of the concordance flat ÎCDM model to make predictions for the galaxy-mass correlations and compare them with the recent Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) weak-lensing measurements of Sheldon et al. The simulations resolve both isolated galaxy-sized host halos and satellite halos (subhalos) within them. We use a simple scheme based on matching the circular velocity function of halos to the galaxy luminosity function and on using the observed density-color correlation of the SDSS galaxies to assign luminosities and colors to the halos. This allows us to closely match the selection criteria used to define observational samples. The simulations reproduce the observed galaxy-mass correlation function and the observed dependence of its shape and amplitude on luminosity and color, if a reasonable amount of scatter between galaxy luminosity and circular velocity is assumed. We find that the luminosity dependence of the correlation function is primarily determined by the changing relative contribution of central and satellite galaxies at different luminosities. The color dependence of the galaxy-mass correlations reflects the difference in the typical environments of blue and red galaxies. We compare the cross-biases, bxâ¡b/r, measured in simulations and observations and find a good agreement at all probed scales. We show that the galaxy-mass correlation coefficient r is close to unity on scales greater than {\textasciitilde}1 h-1 Mpc. This indicates that the cross-bias measured in weak-lensing observations should measure the actual bias b of galaxy clustering on these scales. In agreement with previous studies, we find that the aperture mass-to-light ratio is independent of galaxy color in the range of luminosities probed by observational samples. The aperture mass scales approximately linearly with luminosity at Lr{\textgreater}1010h-2 Lsolar, while at lower luminosities the scaling is shallower: MÎÎ£{\textasciitilde}L0.5r. We show that most of the luminous galaxies (Mr{\textless}-21) are near the centers of their halos and that their galaxy-mass correlation function at r{\textless}{\textasciitilde}100h-1 kpc can therefore be interpreted as the average dark matter density profile of these galaxies. Finally, we find that for galaxies in a given narrow luminosity range, there is a broad and possibly non-Gaussian distribution of halo virial masses. Therefore, the average relation between mass and luminosity derived from the weak-lensing analyses should be interpreted with caution.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present a new, essentially empirical, model for the relation between the mass of a dark matter halo/subhalo and the luminosity of a galaxy hosted in it. To estimate this, we replace the assumption of linearity between light and mass fluctuations with the assumption of monotonicity between galaxy light and halo or subhalo mass. We are enabled to proceed with this less restrictive ansatz by the availability of new, very high-resolution dark matter simulations and more detailed and comprehensive global galactic luminosity functions. We find that the relation between halo/subhalo mass and hosted galaxy luminosity is fairly well fitted by a double power law. The relation between halo mass and group luminosity has a shallower slope for an intermediate-mass region and is fairly well fitted by a two-branch function, with both branches double power laws. Both relations asymptote to L{\textasciitilde}M4 at low M, while at high mass the former follows L{\textasciitilde}M0.28 and the latter L{\textasciitilde}M0.9. In addition to the mass-luminosity relation, we also derive results for the occupation number, luminosity function of cluster galaxies, group luminosity function and multiplicity function. Then, using a prescription for the mass function of haloes in under/overdense regions and some further assumptions on the form of the mass density distribution function, we further derive results for biasing between mass and light and mass and galaxy number, the light distribution function and the void probability distribution. Our results for the most part seem to match well with observations and previous expectations. We feel this is a potentially powerful way of modelling the relation between halo mass and galaxy luminosity, because the main inputs are readily testable against dark matter simulation results and galaxy surveys, and the outputs are free from the uncertainties of physically modelling galaxy formation.},

	abstract = {The relationship between galaxies and dark matter (DM) can be characterized by the halo mass of the central galaxy and the fraction of galaxies that are satellites. Here, we present observational constraints from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey on these quantities as a function of r-band luminosity and stellar mass using galaxy-galaxy weak lensing, with a total of 351507 lenses. We use stellar masses derived from spectroscopy and virial halo masses derived from weak gravitational lensing to determine the efficiency with which baryons in the halo of the central galaxy have been converted into stars. We find that an L* galaxy with a stellar mass of 6 Ã 1010Msolar is hosted by a halo with mass of 1.4 Ã 1012h-1Msolar, independent of morphology, yielding baryon conversion efficiencies of 17+10-5 per cent (early-types) and 16+15-6 per cent (late-types) at the 95 per cent confidence level (statistical, not including systematic uncertainty due to assumption of a universal initial mass function). We find that for a given stellar mass, the halo mass is independent of morphology below Mstellar = 1011Msolar, in contrast to typically a factor of 2 difference in halo mass between ellipticals and spirals at a fixed luminosity. This suggests that stellar mass is a good proxy for halo mass in this range and should be used preferentially whenever a halo mass selected sample is needed. For higher stellar masses, the conversion efficiency is a declining function of stellar mass, and the differences in halo mass between early- and late-types become larger, reflecting the fact that most group and cluster haloes with masses above 1013Msolar host ellipticals at the centre, while even the brightest central spirals are hosted by haloes of mass below 1013Msolar. We find that the fraction of spirals that are satellites is roughly 10-15 per cent independent of stellar mass or luminosity, while for ellipticals this fraction decreases with stellar mass from 50 per cent at 1010Msolar to 10 per cent at 3 Ã 1011Msolar or 20 per cent at the maximum luminosity considered. We split the elliptical sample by local density, and find that at a given luminosity there is no difference in the signal on scales below 100h-1kpc between high- and low-density regions, suggesting that tidal stripping inside large haloes does not remove most of the DM from the early-type satellites. This result is dominated by haloes in the mass range 1013-1014h-1Msolar, and is an average over all separations from the group or cluster centre.},

	abstract = {The formation of galaxies is studied in the context of the fragmentation of massive diffuse ionized gas clouds. A semiquantitative discussion of the role of cooling indicates that there is a characteristic mass of a galaxy (of the order of 500 billion solar masses) which can fragment out of an ionized medium of density not exceeding 10 to the -25th power g/cu cm, whereas more massive galaxies attain a characteristic radius of the order of 60 kpc. The relationship between binding energy and mass is investigated for spheroidal galaxies. The role of H2 and Ly-alpha cooling in the fragmentation of primordial gas clouds is evaluated, and relatively qualitative arguments indicate that the first stars have masses of at least 0.3 solar mass with a characteristic mass of approximately 20 solar masses. When the average heavy-element abundance by mass exceeds about 0.00001, heavy-element cooling prevails over Ly-alpha cooling, and subsequent fragmentation forms second-generation stars of low characteristic mass.},

	abstract = {A model of galaxy formation is developed in which dissipation plays a role along with purely gravitational processes. The gist of the model is that the distribution of the dominant mass component on all scales arises from purely gravitational clustering, while the observed sizes and luminosity functions of galaxies are determined by gas-dynamical dissipative processes. The model accounts for the large amount of nongaseous 'dark matter', apparently making up about 80\% or more of the virial mass in clusters such as Coma and which may constitute massive halos around large galaxies. At work is a process of self-similar gravitational clustering in an expanding universe. The clustering builds up in hierarchical fashion; the smaller-scale virialized systems merge into an amorphous whole when they are incorporated in a larger bound cluster. Residual gas in the resulting potential wells cools and acquires sufficient concentration to self-gravitate, forming luminous galaxies up to a limiting size. This limit agrees adequately with the masses, luminosities, and radii of large galaxies. On certain specific assumptions, a luminosity function is derived that agrees reasonably well with observation.},

	abstract = {Modeling galaxy formation in a cosmological context presents one of the greatest challenges in astrophysics today, due to the vast range of scales and numerous physical processes involved. Here we review the current status of models that employ two leading techniques to simulate the physics of galaxy formation: semi-analytic models and numerical hydrodynamic simulations. We focus on a set of observational targets that describe the evolution of the global and structural properties of galaxies from roughly Cosmic High Noon (\$z\sim 2-3\$) to the present. Although minor discrepancies remain, overall, models show remarkable convergence between different methods and make predictions that are in qualitative agreement with observations. Modelers seem to have converged on a core set of physical processes that are critical for shaping galaxy properties. This core set includes cosmological accretion, strong stellar-driven winds that are more efficient at low masses, black hole feedback that preferentially suppresses star formation at high masses, and structural and morphological evolution through merging and environmental processes. However, all cosmological models currently adopt phenomenological implementations of many of these core processes, which must be tuned to observations. Many details of how these diverse processes interact within a hierarchical structure formation setting remain poorly understood. Emerging multi-scale simulations are helping to bridge the gap between stellar and cosmological scales, placing models on a firmer, more physically grounded footing. Concurrently, upcoming telescope facilities will provide new challenges and constraints for models, particularly by directly constraining inflows and outflows through observations of gas in and around galaxies.},

Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) selected by their colours to be at z=2.5-5, are used as a background sample and are cross-correlated to foreground lens galaxies, which are selected by accurate photometric redshifts (photo-zâs). The signals of LBGs in diï¬erent magnitude bins are compared to predictions from WL theory. An optimally weighted correlation function is estimated by taking into account the slope of external LBG luminosity functions.
Results. For the ï¬rst time, we detect cosmic magniï¬cation in a sample of normal galaxies. These background sources are also the ones with the highest redshifts so far used for WL measurements. The amplitude and angular dependence of the cross-correlation functions agree well with theoretical expectations and the lensing signal is detected with high signiï¬cance. Avoiding low-redshift ranges in the foreground samples which might contaminate the LBG samples we can make a measurement that is virtually free of systematics. In particular, we detect an anti-correlation between faint LBGs and foreground galaxies which cannot be caused by redshift overlap.
Conclusions. Cross-correlating LBGs (and in future also photo-z selected galaxies) as background sources to well understood foreground samples based on accurate photo-zâs will become a powerful cosmological probe in future large imaging surveys.},

The 393 objects observed cover a 26.2 arcmin{\textasciicircum}2{\textasciicircum} area and constitute a nearly complete sample down to K = 20, I = 23, and B = 24.5. The rest-frame K- band luminosity function and its evolution with redshift are described. Comparisons are made with other optically selected (B and I) samples in the literature, and the corresponding rest-frame B-band luminosity function evolution is presented. The B-band counts at B {\textasciitilde} 24 are shown to be a mixture of normal galaxies at modest redshifts and galaxies undergoing rapid star formation, which have a wide range of masses and which are spread over the redshift interval from z = 0.2 to beyond z = 1.7. The luminosity functions, number counts, and color distributions at optical and IR wavelengths are discussed in terms of a consistent picture of the star-forming history of the galaxy sample. [O II] emission-line diagnostics or rest-frame ultraviolet-infrared color information are used in combination with rest-frame absolute H magnitudes to construct a "fundamental plane" in which the evolution of the global star-formation rate with redshift can be shown, and we find that the maximum rest-frame K luminosity of galaxies undergoing rapid star formation has been declining smoothly with decreasing redshift from a value near L\_*\_ at z {\textgreater} 1. This smooth decrease in the characteristic luminosity of galaxies dominated by star formation can simultaneously account for the high B- band galaxy counts at faint magnitudes and the redshift distribution at z {\textless} 1 in both the B- and K-selected samples. Finally, the overall K-band light density evolution is discussed as a tracer of the baryonic mass in stars and compared with the overall rates of star formation inferred from the rest-frame ultraviolet light density as a function of redshift.},

We ï¬nd a striking improvement with respect to the original Illustris simulation, as well as excellent quantitative agreement with the observations, with a sharp transition in median colour from blue to red at a characteristic M â¼ 1010.5 M . Investigating the build-up of the colourâmass plane and the formation of the red sequence, we demonstrate that the primary driver of galaxy colour transition is supermassive black hole feedback in its low accretion state. Across the entire population the median colour transition time-scale tgreen is â¼1.6 Gyr, a value which drops for increasingly massive galaxies. We ï¬nd signatures of the physical process of quenching: at ï¬xed stellar mass, redder galaxies have lower star formation rates, gas fractions, and gas metallicities; their stellar populations are also older and their large-scale interstellar magnetic ï¬elds weaker than in bluer galaxies.

	abstract = {Feedback from massive stars is believed to play a critical role in driving galactic super-winds that enrich the IGM and shape the galaxy mass function and mass-metallicity relation. In previous papers, we introduced new numerical methods for implementing stellar feedback on sub-GMC through galactic scales in galaxy simulations. This includes radiation pressure (UV through IR), SNe (Type-I \& II), stellar winds ('fast' O-star through 'slow' AGB winds), and HII photoionization. Here, we show that these feedback mechanisms drive galactic winds with outflow rates as high as {\textasciitilde}10-20 times the galaxy SFR. The mass-loading efficiency (wind mass loss rate divided by SFR) scales inversely with circular velocity, consistent with momentum-conservation expectations. We study the contributions of each feedback mechanism to galactic winds in a range of galaxy models, from SMC-like dwarfs \& MW-analogues to z{\textasciitilde}2 clumpy disks. In massive, gas-rich systems (local starbursts and high-z galaxies), radiation pressure dominates the wind generation. For MW-like spirals and dwarf galaxies the gas densities are much lower, and shock-heated gas from SNe and stellar winds dominates production of large-scale outflows. In all models, however, winds have a multi-phase structure that depends on interactions between multiple feedback mechanisms operating on different spatial \& time scales: any single mechanism fails to reproduce the winds observed. We provide fitting functions for wind mass-loading and velocities as a function of galaxy properties, for use in cosmological simulations and semi-analytic models. These differ from typically-adopted formulae with explicit dependence on gas surface density that can be very important in both low-density dwarf galaxies and high-density gas-rich galaxies.},

	abstract = {We show that the most distant X-ray detected cluster known to date, ClJ1001 at z=2.506, hosts a strong overdensity of radio sources. Six of them are individually detected (within 10") in deep 0.75" resolution VLA 3GHz imaging, with S(3GHz){\textgreater}8uJy. Of the six, AGN likely affects the radio emission in two galaxies while star formation is the dominant source powering the remaining four. We searched for cluster candidates over the full COSMOS 2-square degree field using radio-detected 3GHz sources and looking for peaks in Sigma5 density maps. ClJ1001 is the strongest overdensity by far with {\textgreater}10sigma, with a simple z\_phot{\textgreater}1.5 preselection. A cruder photometric rejection of z{\textless}1 radio foregrounds leaves ClJ1001 as the second strongest overdensity, while even using all radio sources ClJ1001 remains among the four strongest projected overdensities. We conclude that there are great prospects for future, deep and wide-area radio surveys to discover large samples of the first generation of forming galaxy clusters. In these remarkable structures widespread star formation and AGN activity of massive galaxy cluster members, residing within the inner cluster core, will ultimately lead to radio continuum as one of the most effective means for their identification, with detection rates expected in the ballpark of 0.1-1 per square degree at z{\textgreater}2.5. Samples of hundreds such high-redshift clusters could potentially constrain cosmological parameters and test cluster and galaxy formation models.},

	abstract = {We report the discovery of a remarkable concentration of massive galaxies with extended X-ray emission at \$z\_\{spec\} = 2.506\$, which contains 11 massive (\$M\_\{*\} \gtrsim 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\} M\_\{\odot\}\$) galaxies in the central 80kpc region (11.6\$\sigma\$ overdensity). We have spectroscopically confirmed 17 member galaxies with 11 from CO and the remaining ones from \$H\alpha\$. The X-ray luminosity, stellar mass content and velocity dispersion all point to a collapsed, cluster-sized dark matter halo with mass \$M\_\{200c\} = 10{\textasciicircum}\{13.9\pm0.2\} M\_\{\odot\}\$, making it the most distant X-ray-detected cluster known to date. Unlike other clusters discovered so far, this structure is dominated by star-forming galaxies (SFGs) in the core with only 2 out of the 11 massive galaxies classified as quiescent. The star formation rate (SFR) in the 80kpc core reaches \$\sim\$3400 \$M\_\{\odot\}\$ yr\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ with a gas depletion time of \$\sim 200\$ Myr, suggesting that we caught this cluster in rapid build-up of a dense core. The high SFR is driven by both a high abundance of SFGs and a higher starburst fraction (\$\sim25\\%\$, compared to 3\\%-5\\% in the field). The presence of both a collapsed, cluster-sized halo and a predominant population of massive SFGs suggests that this structure could represent an important transition phase between protoclusters and mature clusters. It provides evidence that the main phase of massive galaxy passivization will take place after galaxies accrete onto the cluster, providing new insights into massive cluster formation at early epochs. The large integrated stellar mass at such high redshift challenges our understanding of massive cluster formation.},

	abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

	abstract = {We present a new two-color algorithm, the "Stellar Bump Sequence" (SBS), that is optimized for robustly identifying candidate high-redshift galaxy clusters in combined wide-field optical and mid-infrared (MIR) data. The SBS algorithm is a fusion of the well-tested cluster red-sequence method of Gladders \& Yee (2000) with the MIR 3.6um - 4.5um cluster detection method developed by Papovich (2008). As with the cluster red-sequence method, the SBS identifies candidate overdensities within 3.6um - 4.5um color slices, which are the equivalent of a rest-frame 1.6um stellar bump "red-sequence". In addition to employing the MIR colors of galaxies, the SBS algorithm incorporates an optical/MIR (z' - 3.6um) color cut. This cut effectively eliminates foreground 0.2 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.4 galaxies which have 3.6um - 4.5um colors that are similarly red as z {\textgreater} 1.0 galaxies and add noise when searching for high-redshift galaxy overdensities. We demonstrate using the z {\textasciitilde} 1 GCLASS cluster sample that similar to the red sequence, the stellar bump sequence appears to be a ubiquitous feature of high-redshift clusters, and that within that sample the color of the stellar bump sequence increases monotonically with redshift and provides photometric redshifts accurate to dz = 0.05. We apply the SBS method in the XMM-LSS SWIRE field and show that it robustly recovers the majority of confirmed optical, MIR, and X-ray-selected clusters at z {\textgreater} 1.0 in that field. Lastly, we present confirmation of SpARCS J022427-032354 at z = 1.63, a new cluster detected with the method and confirmed with 12 high-confidence spectroscopic redshifts obtained using FORS2 on the VLT. We conclude with a discussion of future prospects for using the algorithm.},

The clusters were identiï¬ed as Spitzer/IRAC color-selected overdensities in the Clusters Around Radio-Loud AGN (CARLA) project, which imaged 421 powerful radio-loud AGN at z {\textgreater} 1.3. The luminosity functions are derived for diï¬erent redshift and richness bins, and the IRAC imaging reaches depths of mâ + 2, allowing us to measure the faint end slopes of the luminosity functions. We ï¬nd that Î± = â1 describes the luminosity function very well in all redshifts bins and does not evolve signiï¬cantly. This provides evidence that the rate at which the low mass galaxy population grows through star formation, gets quenched and is replenished by in-falling ï¬eld galaxies does not have a major net eï¬ect on the shape of the luminosity function. Our measurements for mâ are consistent with passive evolution models and high formation redshifts (zf â¼ 3). We ï¬nd a slight trend towards fainter mâ for the richest clusters, implying that the most massive clusters in our sample could contain older stellar populations, yet another example of cosmic downsizing. Modelling shows that a contribution of a star-forming population of up to 40 \% cannot be ruled out. This value, found from our targeted survey, is signiï¬cantly lower than the values found for slightly lower redshift, z â¼ 1, clusters found in wide-ï¬eld surveys. The results are consistent with cosmic downsizing, as the clusters studied here were all found in the vicinity of radio-loud AGNs â which have proven to be preferentially located in massive dark matter halos in the richest environments at high redshift â and may therefore be older and more evolved systems than the general protocluster population.},

In this work we present our data reduction techniques, and document the resulting mosaics, coverage maps, and catalogs in both IRAC passbands for the three easternmost UltraVISTA survey stripes, covering a combined area of about 0.66 deg2, of which 0.45 deg2 have at least 20 hr integration time. SMUVS reaches point-source sensitivities of about 25.0 AB mag (0.13 ÂµJy) at both 3.6 and 4.5 Âµm with a signiï¬cance of 4Ï, accounting for both survey sensitivity and source confusion. To this limit the SMUVS catalogs contain a total of â¼350,000 sources, each of which is detected signiï¬cantly in at least one IRAC band. Because of its uniform and high sensitivity, relatively large area coverage, and the wide array of ancillary data available in COSMOS, the SMUVS survey will be useful for a large number of cosmological investigations.

Comparisons with other SMFs at approximately the same redshift but determined using shorter wavelengths show good agreement. This agreement suggests that selection at bluer wavelengths does not miss a signiï¬cant amount of stellar mass in passive galaxies. Comparison with SMFs at other redshifts shows evidence for the downsizing scenario of galaxy evolution.

To mitigate the effects of cosmic variance and also to take advantage of deep coextensive coverage in multiple bands by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Multi-cycle Treasury Program CANDELS, S-CANDELS was carried out within ï¬ve widely separated extragalactic ï¬elds: the UKIDSS Ultra-deep Survey, the Extended Chandra Deep Field South, COSMOS, the HST Deep Field North, and the Extended Groth Strip. S-CANDELS builds upon the existing coverage of these ï¬elds from the Spitzer Extended Deep Survey (SEDS), a Cycle 6 Exploration Program, by increasing the integration time from SEDSâ 12 hr to a total of 50 hr but within a smaller area, 0.16 deg2. The additional depth signiï¬cantly increases the survey completeness at faint magnitudes. This paper describes the S-CANDELS survey design, processing, and publicly available data products. We present Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) dual-band 3.6 + 4.5 mm catalogs reaching to a depth of 26.5 AB mag. Deep IRAC counts for the roughly 135,000 galaxies detected by S-CANDELS are consistent with models based on known galaxy populations. The increase in depth beyond earlier Spitzer/IRAC surveys does not reveal a signiï¬cant additional contribution from discrete sources to the diffuse Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB). Thus it remains true that only roughly half of the estimated CIB ï¬ux from COBE/DIRBE is resolved.},

	abstract = {We present 279 galaxy cluster candidates at z {\textgreater} 1.3 selected from the 94 deg2 Spitzer South Pole Telescope Deep Field (SSDF) survey. We use a simple algorithm to select candidate high-redshift clusters of galaxies based on Spitzer/IRAC mid-infrared data combined with shallow all-sky optical data. We identify distant cluster candidates adopting an overdensity threshold that results in a high purity (80\%) cluster sample based on tests in the Spitzer Deep, Wide-Field Survey of the BooÂ¨tes ï¬eld. Our simple algorithm detects all three 1.4 {\textless} z 1.75 X-ray detected clusters in the BooÂ¨tes ï¬eld. The uniqueness of the SSDF survey resides not just in its area, one of the largest contiguous extragalactic ï¬elds observed with Spitzer, but also in its deep, multi-wavelength coverage by the South Pole Telescope (SPT), Herschel/SPIRE, and XMM-Newton. This rich data set will allow direct or stacked measurements of SunyaevâZelâdovich effect decrements or X-ray masses for many of the SSDF clusters presented here, and enable a systematic study of the most distant clusters on an unprecedented scale. We measure the angular correlation function of our sample and ï¬nd that these candidates show strong clustering. Employing the COSMOS/UltraVista photometric catalog in order to infer the redshift distribution of our cluster selection, we ï¬nd that these clusters have a comoving number density nc = (0.7+â60..36) Ã 10â7 h3 Mpcâ3 and a spatial clustering correlation scale length r0 = (32 Â± 7) hâ1 Mpc. Assuming our sample is comprised of dark matter halos above a characteristic minimum mass, Mmin, we derive that at z = 1.5 these clusters reside in halos larger than Mmin = 1.5+â00..97 Ã 1014 hâ1 M . We ï¬nd that the mean mass of our cluster sample is equal to Mmean = 1.9+â10..08 Ã 1014 hâ1 M ; thus, our sample contains the progenitors of present-day massive galaxy clusters.},

SEDS covers a total area of 1.46 deg2 to a depth of 26 AB mag (3Ï ) in both of the warm Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) bands at 3.6 and 4.5 Î¼m. Because of its uniform depth of coverage in so many widely-separated ï¬elds, SEDS is subject to roughly 25\% smaller errors due to cosmic variance than a single-ï¬eld survey of the same size. SEDS was designed to detect and characterize galaxies from intermediate to high redshifts (z = 2â7) with a built-in means of assessing the impact of cosmic variance on the individual ï¬elds. Because the full SEDS depth was accumulated in at least three separate visits to each ï¬eld, typically with six-month intervals between visits, SEDS also furnishes an opportunity to assess the infrared variability of faint objects. This paper describes the SEDS survey design, processing, and publicly-available data products. Deep IRAC counts for the more than 300,000 galaxies detected by SEDS are consistent with models based on known galaxy populations. Discrete IRAC sources contribute 5.6 Â± 1.0 and 4.4 Â± 0.8 nW mâ2 srâ1 at 3.6 and 4.5 Î¼m to the diffuse cosmic infrared background (CIB). IRAC sources cannot contribute more than half of the total CIB ï¬ux estimated from DIRBE data.

Our procedures follow the detailed assembly history of each object and are able to track the evolution of all galaxies more massive than the Small Magellanic Cloud throughout a volume comparable to that of large modern redshift surveys. In this ï¬rst paper we supplement previous treatments of the growth and activity of central black holes with a new model for âradioâ feedback from those AGN that lie at the centre of a quasistatic X-ray emitting atmosphere in a galaxy group or cluster. We show that for energetically and observationally plausible parameters such a model can simultaneously explain: (i) the low observed mass drop-out rate in cooling ï¬ows; (ii) the exponential cut-oï¬ at the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function; and (iii) the fact that the most massive galaxies tend to be bulge-dominated systems in clusters and to contain systematically older stars than lower mass galaxies. This success occurs because static hot atmospheres form only in the most massive structures, and radio feedback (in contrast, for example, to supernova or starburst feedback) can suppress further cooling and star formation without itself requiring star formation. We discuss possible physical models which might explain the accretion rate scalings required for our phenomenological âradio modeâ model to be successful.},

	abstract = {A simple, observationally-motivated model is presented for understanding how halo masses, galaxy stellar masses, and star formation rates are related, and how these relations evolve with time. The relation between halo mass and galaxy stellar mass is determined by matching the observed spatial abundance of galaxies to the expected spatial abundance of halos at multiple epochs -- i.e. more massive galaxies are assigned to more massive halos at each epoch. Halos at different epochs are connected by halo mass accretion histories estimated from N-body simulations. The halo--galaxy connection at fixed epochs in conjunction with the connection between halos across time provides a connection between observed galaxies across time. With approximations for the impact of merging and accretion on the growth of galaxies, one can then directly infer the star formation histories of galaxies as a function of stellar and halo mass. This model is tuned to match both the observed evolution of the stellar mass function and the normalization of the observed star formation rate -- stellar mass relation to z{\textasciitilde}1. The data demands, for example, that the star formation rate density is dominated by galaxies with Mstar{\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}\{10.0-10.5\} Msun from 0{\textless}z{\textless}1, and that such galaxies over these epochs reside in halos with M{\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}\{11.5-12.5\} Msun. The star formation rate -- halo mass relation is approximately Gaussian over the range 0{\textless}z{\textless}1 with a mildly evolving mean and normalization. This model is then used to shed light on a number of issues, including 1) a clarification of ``downsizing'', 2) the lack of a sharp characteristic halo mass at which star formation is truncated, and 3) the dominance of star formation over merging to the stellar build-up of galaxies with Mstar{\textless}10{\textasciicircum}11 Msun at z{\textless}1.},

Based on cosmological hydrodynamic simulations that include a prescription where quenching occurs in regions dominated by hot ({\textgreater}105.4 K) gas, we argue that this hot gas quenching in haloes {\textgreater}1012 M drives both mass quenching (i.e. central quenching) and environment quenching (i.e. satellite quenching). These simulations reproduce a broad range of locally observed trends among quenching, halo mass, stellar mass, environment, and distance to halo centre. Mass quenching is independent of environment because â¼1012â1013 M âmass quenching haloesâ inhabit a large range of environments. On the other hand, environment quenching is independent of stellar mass because galaxies of all stellar masses may live in dense environments as satellites of groups and clusters. As in observations, the quenched fraction of satellites increases with halo mass and decreases with distance to the centre of the group or cluster. We investigate pre-processing in group haloes, ejected former satellites, and hot gas that extends beyond the virial radius. The agreement of our model with key observational trends suggests that hot gas in massive haloes plays a leading role in quenching low-redshift galaxies.},

	abstract = {The environment is known to affect the formation and evolution of galaxies considerably best visible through the well-known morphology-density relationship. In this paper we study the effect of environment on the evolution of early-type galaxies by analysing the stellar population properties of 3,360 galaxies morphologically selected by visual inspection from the SDSS in the redshift range 0.05{\textless}z{\textless}0.06. We find that the distribution of ages is bimodal with a strong peak at old ages and a secondary peak at young ages around {\textasciitilde} 2.5Gyr containing about 10 per cent of the objects. This is analogue to 'red sequence' and 'blue cloud' identified in galaxy populations usually containing both early and late type galaxies. The fraction of the young, rejuvenated galaxies increases with both decreasing galaxy mass and decreasing environmental density up to about 45 per cent. The rejuvenated galaxies have lower alpha/Fe ratios than the average and most of them show signs of ongoing star formation through their emission line spectra. All objects that host AGN in their centres without star formation are part of the red sequence population. We confirm and statistically strengthen earlier results that luminosity weighted ages, metallicities, and alpha/Fe element ratios of the red sequence population correlate well with velocity dispersion and galaxy mass. Most interestingly, however, these scaling relations are not sensitive to environmental densities and are only driven by galaxy mass. We infer that early-type galaxy formation has undergone a phase transition a few billion years ago around z{\textasciitilde}0.2. A self-regulated formation phase without environmental dependence has recently been superseded by a rejuvenation phase, in which the environment plays a decisive role possibly through galaxy interactions.},

We concentrate on a galaxy formation model which is tuned to fit the joint luminosity/colour/morphology distribution of low-redshift galaxies. Massive ellipticals in this model have higher metal abundances, older luminosity-weighted ages and shorter star formation time-scales, but lower assembly redshifts, than less massive systems. Within clusters the typical masses, ages and metal abundances of ellipticals are predicted to decrease, on average, with increasing distance from the cluster centre. We also quantify the effective number of progenitors of ellipticals as a function of present stellar mass, finding typical numbers below two for M* \&lt; 1011 Mâ, rising to approximately five for the most massive systems. These findings are consistent with recent observational results that suggest âdown-sizingâ or âantihierarchicalâ behaviour for the star formation history of the elliptical galaxy population, despite the fact that our model includes all the standard elements of hierarchical galaxy formation and is implemented on the standard, ÎCDM cosmogony.},

To interpret the observed galaxy clustering, we use a phenomenological halo model, combined with a novel method to account for uncertainties arising from the use of photometric redshifts. We find that the satellite fraction decreases with increasing redshift and that the clustering amplitude (e.g., comoving correlation length/large-scale bias) displays monotonic trends with redshift and stellar mass. Applying ÎCDM halo mass accretion histories and cumulative abundance arguments for the evolution of stellar mass content, we propose pathways for the coevolution of dark matter and stellar mass assembly. Additionally, we are able to estimate that the halo mass at which the ratio of stellar-to-halo mass is maximized is at .

The differential effects of mass and environment are completely separable to z {\textasciitilde} 1, indicating that two distinct processes are operating, "mass-quenching" and "environment-quenching". Environment-quenching, at fixed over-density, evidently does not change with epoch to z {\textasciitilde} 1, suggesting that it occurs as large-scale structure develops in the Universe. The observed constancy of the mass-function shape for star-forming galaxies, demands that the mass-quenching of galaxies around and above M*, must be proportional to their star-formation rates at all z {\textless} 2. We postulate that this simple mass-quenching law also holds over a much broader range of stellar mass and epoch. These two simple quenching processes, plus some additional quenching due to merging, then naturally produce (a) a quasi-static Schechter mass function for star-forming galaxies with a value of M* that is set by the proportionality between the star-formation and mass-quenching rates, (b) a double Schechter function for passive galaxies with two components: the dominant one is produced by mass-quenching and has exactly the same M* as the star-forming galaxies but an alpha shallower by +1, while the other is produced by environment effects and has the same M* and alpha as the star-forming galaxies, and is larger in high density environments. Subsequent merging of quenched galaxies modifies these predictions somewhat in the denser environments, slightly increasing M* and making alpha more negative. All of these detailed quantitative relationships between the Schechter parameters are indeed seen in the SDSS, lending strong support to our simple empirically-based model. The model naturally produces for passive galaxies the "anti-hierarchical" run of mean ages and alpha-element abundances with mass.},

In this work we measure the merger fraction, {\textless}i{\textgreater}f{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}m{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, of galaxies in the VVDS-Deep spectroscopic survey, and study its dependence on the {\textless}i{\textgreater}B{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-band luminosity ratio the pair galaxies, {\textless}i{\textgreater}Î¼{\textless}i/{\textgreater} â¡ {\textless}i{\textgreater}L{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater}B,{\textless}i/{\textgreater}2{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}/{\textless}i{\textgreater}L{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater}B,{\textless}i/{\textgreater}1{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, focusing on minor mergers with 1/10 â¤ {\textless}i{\textgreater}Î¼{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textless} 1/4, and on the rest-frame {\textless}i{\textgreater}NUV{\textless}i/{\textgreater} â {\textless}i{\textgreater}r{\textless}i/{\textgreater} colour of the principal galaxies.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We use spectroscopic pairs with redshift {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} â² 1 in the VVDS-Deep survey to define kinematical close pairs as those galaxies with a separation on the sky plane and a relative velocity Î{\textless}i{\textgreater}v{\textless}i/{\textgreater} â¤ 500 km s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} in redshift space. We vary from 30 {\textless}i{\textgreater}h{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} kpc to 100 {\textless}i{\textgreater}h{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} kpc. We study {\textless}i{\textgreater}f{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}m{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} in two redshift intervals and for several values of {\textless}i{\textgreater}Î¼{\textless}i/{\textgreater}, from 1/2 to 1/10. We take {\textless}i{\textgreater}Î¼{\textless}i/{\textgreater} â¥ 1/4 and 1/10 â¤ {\textless}i{\textgreater}Î¼{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textless} 1/4 as major and minor mergers.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} The merger fraction increases with {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} and its dependence on {\textless}i{\textgreater}Î¼{\textless}i/{\textgreater} is well described by a power-law function, {\textless}i{\textgreater}f{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater}m{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} ( â¥ {\textless}i{\textgreater}Î¼{\textless}i/{\textgreater}) â {\textless}i{\textgreater}Î¼{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater}s{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}. The value of {\textless}i{\textgreater}s{\textless}i/{\textgreater} evolves from {\textless}i{\textgreater}s{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = â0.60 Â± 0.08 at {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 0.8 to {\textless}i{\textgreater}s{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = â1.02 Â± 0.13 at {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 0.5. The fraction of minor mergers for bright galaxies shows little evolution with redshift as a power-law (1 + {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater}){\textless}sup{\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater}m{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} with index {\textless}i{\textgreater}m{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = â0.4 Â± 0.7 for the merger fraction and {\textless}i{\textgreater}m{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = â0.5 Â± 0.7 for the merger rate, in contrast with the increase in the major merger fraction ({\textless}i{\textgreater}m{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 1.3 Â± 0.5) and rate ({\textless}i{\textgreater}m{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 1.3 Â± 0.6) for the same galaxies. We split our principal galaxies in red and blue, finding that i) {\textless}i{\textgreater}f{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}m{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} is higher for red galaxies at every {\textless}i{\textgreater}Î¼{\textless}i/{\textgreater}, ii) does not evolve with {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater}, with {\textless}i{\textgreater}s{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = â0.79 Â± 0.12 at 0.2 {\textless} {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textless} 0.95, and iii) evolves dramatically: the major merger fraction of blue galaxies decreases by a factor of three with cosmic time, while the minor merger fraction of blue galaxies is roughly constant. {\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Our results show that the mass of normal galaxies has grown by about 25\% since {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textasciitilde} 1 because of the combined effects of minor and major mergers. The relative contribution of the mass growth by merging is {\textasciitilde} 25\% due to minor mergers and {\textasciitilde} 75\% due to major mergers. The relative effect of merging is more important for red than for blue galaxies, with red galaxies subject to 0.5 minor and 0.7 major mergers since {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textasciitilde} 1, which leads to a mass growth of {\textasciitilde} 40\% and a size increase by a factor of 2. Our results also suggest that, for blue galaxies, minor mergers likely lead to early-type spirals rather than elliptical galaxies. These results show that minor merging is a significant but not dominant mechanism contributing to the mass growth of galaxies in the last {\textasciitilde} 8 Gyr.},

	abstract = {We present the first results based on Planck measurements of the CMB temperature and lensing-potential power spectra. The Planck spectra at high multipoles are extremely well described by the standard spatially-flat six-parameter LCDM cosmology. In this model Planck data determine the cosmological parameters to high precision. We find a low value of the Hubble constant, H0=67.3+/-1.2 km/s/Mpc and a high value of the matter density parameter, Omega\_m=0.315+/-0.017 (+/-1 sigma errors) in excellent agreement with constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) surveys. Including curvature, we find that the Universe is consistent with spatial flatness to percent-level precision using Planck CMB data alone. We present results from an analysis of extensions to the standard cosmology, using astrophysical data sets in addition to Planck and high-resolution CMB data. None of these models are favoured significantly over standard LCDM. The deviation of the scalar spectral index from unity is insensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changes in the matter content of the Universe. We find a 95\% upper limit of r{\textless}0.11 on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. There is no evidence for additional neutrino-like relativistic particles. Using BAO and CMB data, we find N\_eff=3.30+/-0.27 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, and an upper limit of 0.23 eV for the summed neutrino mass. Our results are in excellent agreement with big bang nucleosynthesis and the standard value of N\_eff=3.046. We find no evidence for dynamical dark energy. Despite the success of the standard LCDM model, this cosmology does not provide a good fit to the CMB power spectrum at low multipoles, as noted previously by the WMAP team. While not of decisive significance, this is an anomaly in an otherwise self-consistent analysis of the Planck temperature data.},

	abstract = {We discuss the cosmological simulation code GADGET-2, a new massively parallel TreeSPH code, capable of following a collisionless fluid with the N-body method, and an ideal gas by means of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). Our implementation of SPH manifestly conserves energy and entropy in regions free of dissipation, while allowing for fully adaptive smoothing lengths. Gravitational forces are computed with a hierarchical multipole expansion, which can optionally be applied in the form of a TreePM algorithm, where only short-range forces are computed with the `tree' method while long-range forces are determined with Fourier techniques. Time integration is based on a quasi-symplectic scheme where long-range and short-range forces can be integrated with different time-steps. Individual and adaptive short-range time-steps may also be employed. The domain decomposition used in the parallelization algorithm is based on a space-filling curve, resulting in high flexibility and tree force errors that do not depend on the way the domains are cut. The code is efficient in terms of memory consumption and required communication bandwidth. It has been used to compute the first cosmological N-body simulation with more than 1010 dark matter particles, reaching a homogeneous spatial dynamic range of 105 per dimension in a three-dimensional box. It has also been used to carry out very large cosmological SPH simulations that account for radiative cooling and star formation, reaching total particle numbers of more than 250 million. We present the algorithms used by the code and discuss their accuracy and performance using a number of test problems. GADGET-2 is publicly released to the research community.},

	abstract = {Although a fair amount of work has been devoted to growing Monte-Carlo merger trees which resemble those built from an N-body simulation, comparatively little effort has been invested in quantifying the caveats one necessarily encounters when one extracts trees directly from such a simulation. To somewhat revert the tide, this paper seeks to provide its reader with a comprehensive study of the problems one faces when following this route. The first step to building merger histories of dark matter haloes and their subhaloes is to identify these structures in each of the time outputs (snapshots) produced by the simulation. Even though we discuss a particular implementation of such an algorithm (called AdaptaHOP) in this paper, we believe that our results do not depend on the exact details of the implementation but extend to most if not all (sub)structure finders. We then highlight different ways to build merger histories from AdaptaHOP haloes and subhaloes, contrasting their various advantages and drawbacks. We find that the best approach to (sub)halo merging histories is through an analysis that goes back and forth between identification and tree building rather than one which conducts a straightforward sequential treatment of these two steps. This is rooted in the complexity of the merging trees which have to depict an inherently dynamical process from the partial temporal information contained in the collection of instantaneous snapshots available from the N-body simulation.},

	abstract = {We measure the anisotropy of dark matter flows on small scales ({\textasciitilde}500 kpc) in the near environment of haloes using a large set of simulations. We rely on two different approaches to quantify the anisotropy of the cosmic infall: we measure the flows at the virial radius of the haloes while describing the infalling matter via fluxes through a spherical shell; and we measure the spatial and kinematical distributions of satellites and substructures around haloes detected by the subclump finder ADAPTAHOP described for the first time in the appendix. The two methods are found to be in agreement both qualitatively and quantitatively via one- and two-point statistics. The peripheral and advected momenta are correlated with the spin of the embedded halo at levels of 30 and 50 per cent. The infall takes place preferentially in the plane perpendicular to the direction defined by the spin of the halo. We computed the excess of equatorial accretion both through rings and via a harmonic expansion of the infall. The level of anisotropy of infalling matter is found to be {\textasciitilde}15 per cent. The substructures have their spin orthogonal to their velocity vector in the rest frame of the halo at a level of about 5 per cent, suggestive of an image of a flow along filamentary structures, which provides an explanation for the measured anisotropy. Using a `synthetic' stacked halo, it is shown that the positions and orientations of satellites relative to the direction of spin of the halo are not random even in projection. The average ellipticity of stacked haloes is 10 per cent, while the alignment excess in projection reaches 2 per cent. All measured correlations are fitted by a simple three-parameter model. We conclude that a halo does not see its environment as an isotropic perturbation, we investigate how the anisotropy is propagated inwards using perturbation theory, and we discuss briefly the implications for weak lensing, warps and the thickness of galactic discs.},

We consider dark energy models that are both minimally and non-minimally coupled, massive neutrinos and modified gravitational forces with chameleon and Vainshtein screening mechanisms. In all cases, we compare halo-model power spectra to measurements from high-resolution simulations. We show that the tuned halo-model method can predict the non-linear matter power spectrum measured from simulations of parametrized w(a) dark energy models at the few per cent level for kÂ \&lt;Â 10âhâMpcâ1, and we present theoretically motivated extensions to cover non-minimally coupled scalar fields, massive neutrinos and Vainshtein screened modified gravity models that result in few per cent accurate power spectra for kÂ \&lt;Â 10âhâMpcâ1. For chameleon screened models, we achieve only 10Â perÂ cent accuracy for the same range of scales. Finally, we use our halo model to investigate degeneracies between different extensions to the standard cosmological model, finding that the impact of baryonic feedback on the non-linear matter power spectrum can be considered independently of modified gravity or massive neutrino extensions. In contrast, considering the impact of modified gravity and massive neutrinos independently results in biased estimates of power at the level of 5Â perÂ cent at scales kÂ \&gt;Â 0.5âhâMpcâ1.

	abstract = {We present an optimized variant of the halo model, designed to produce accurate matter power spectra well into the non-linear regime for a wide range of cosmological models. To do this, we introduce physically motivated free parameters into the halo-model formalism and fit these to data from high-resolution N-body simulations. For a variety of Î cold dark matter (ÎCDM) and wCDM models, the halo-model power is accurate to â 5Â perÂ cent for kÂ â¤Â 10hâMpcâ1 and zÂ â¤Â 2. An advantage of our new halo model is that it can be adapted to account for the effects of baryonic feedback on the power spectrum. We demonstrate this by fitting the halo model to power spectra from the OWLS (OverWhelmingly Large Simulations) hydrodynamical simulation suite via parameters that govern halo internal structure. We are able to fit all feedback models investigated at the 5Â perÂ cent level using only two free parameters, and we place limits on the range of these halo parameters for feedback models investigated by the OWLS simulations. Accurate predictions to high k are vital for weak-lensing surveys, and these halo parameters could be considered nuisance parameters to marginalize over in future analyses to mitigate uncertainty regarding the details of feedback. Finally, we investigate how lensing observables predicted by our model compare to those from simulations and from halofit for a range of k-cuts and feedback models and quantify the angular scales at which these effects become important. Code to calculate power spectra from the model presented in this paper can be found at https://github.com/alexander-mead/hmcode.},

	abstract = {We present an updated version of the HMcode augmented halo model that can be used to make accurate predictions of the non-linear matter power spectrum over a wide range of cosmologies. Major improvements include modelling of BAO damping in the power spectrum and an updated treatment of massive neutrinos. We fit our model to simulated power spectra and show that we can match the results with an RMS error of 2.5 per cent across a range of cosmologies, scales \$k {\textless} 10\,h\mathrm\{Mpc\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, and redshifts \$z{\textless}2\$. The error rarely exceeds 5 per cent and never exceeds 16 per cent. The worst-case errors occur at \$z\simeq2\$, or for cosmologies with unusual dark-energy equations of state. This represents a significant improvement over previous versions of HMcode, and over other popular fitting functions, particularly for massive-neutrino cosmologies with high neutrino mass. We also present a simple halo model that can be used to model the impact of baryonic feedback on the power spectrum. This six-parameter physical model includes gas expulsion by AGN feedback and encapsulates star formation. By comparing this model to data from hydrodynamical simulations we demonstrate that the power spectrum response to feedback is matched at the \${\textless}1\$ per cent level for \$z{\textless}1\$ and \$k{\textless}20\,h\mathrm\{Mpc\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. We also present a single-parameter variant of this model, parametrized in terms of feedback strength, which is only slightly less accurate. We make code available for our non-linear and baryon models at https://github.com/alexander-mead/HMcode and it is also available within CAMB and soon within CLASS.},

	abstract = {The abundance of galaxy clusters can constrain both the geometry and growth of structure in our Universe. However, this probe could be significantly complicated by recent claims of nonuniversality -- non-trivial dependences with respect to the cosmological model and redshift. In this work we analyse the dependance of the mass function on the way haloes are identified and establish if this can cause departures from universality. In order to explore this dependance, we use a set of different N-body cosmological simulations (Le SBARBINE simulations), with the latest cosmological parameters from the Planck collaboration; this first suite of simulations is followed by a lower resolution set, carried out with different cosmological parameters. We identify dark matter haloes using a Spherical Overdensity algorithm with varying overdensity thresholds (virial, 2000rho\_c, 1000rho\_c, 500rho\_c, 200rho\_c and 200rho\_b) at all redshifts. We notice that, when expressed in term of the rescaled variable nu, the mass functionfor virial haloes is a nearly universal as a function of redshift and cosmology, while this is clearly not the case for the other overdensities we considered. We provide fitting functions for the halo mass function parameters as a function of overdensity, that allow to predict, to within a few percent accuracy, the halo mass function for a wide range of halo definitions, redshifts and cosmological models. We then show how the departures from universality associated with other halo definitions can be derived by combining the universality of the virial definition with the expected shape of the density profile of halos.},

Essentially all of the non-cluster extragalactic legacy fields are utilized, including the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF), the Hubble Frontier Field parallel fields, and all five CANDELS fields, for a total survey area of 1136 arcmin{\textasciicircum}2. Our determinations include galaxies at z{\textasciitilde}2-3 leveraging the deep HDUV, UVUDF, and ERS WFC3/UVIS observations available over a {\textasciitilde}150 arcmin{\textasciicircum}2 area in the GOODS North and GOODS South regions. All together, our collective samples include {\textgreater}24,000 sources, {\textgreater}2.3x larger than previous selections with HST. 5766, 6332, 7240, 3449, 1066, 601, 246, and 33 sources are identified at z{\textasciitilde}2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, respectively. Combining our results with an earlier z{\textasciitilde}10 LF determination by Oesch+2018a, we quantify the evolution of the \$UV\$ LF. Our results indicate that there is (1) a smooth flattening of the faint-end slope alpha from alpha{\textasciitilde}-2.4 at z{\textasciitilde}10 to -1.5 at z{\textasciitilde}2, (2) minimal evolution in the characteristic luminosity M* at z{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}2.5, and (3) a monotonic increase in the normalization log\_10 phi* from z{\textasciitilde}10 to z{\textasciitilde}2, which can be well described by a simple second-order polynomial, consistent with an "accelerated" evolution scenario. We find that each of these trends (from z{\textasciitilde}10 to z{\textasciitilde}2.5 at least) can be readily explained on the basis of the evolution of the halo mass function and a simple constant star formation efficiency model.},

	abstract = {The IllustrisTNG project is a new suite of cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation performed with the Arepo code and updated models for feedback physics. Here we introduce the first two simulations of the series, TNG100 and TNG300, and quantify the stellar mass content of about 4000 massive galaxy groups and clusters (\$10{\textasciicircum}\{13\} \leq M\_\{\rm 200c\}/M\_\{\rm sun\} \leq 10{\textasciicircum}\{15\}\$) at recent times (\$z \leq 1\$). The richest clusters have half of their total stellar mass bound to satellite galaxies, with the other half being associated with the central galaxy and the diffuse intra-cluster light. The exact ICL fraction depends sensitively on the definition of a central galaxy's mass and varies in our most massive clusters between 20 to 40\% of the total stellar mass. Haloes of \$5\times 10{\textasciicircum}\{14\}M\_\{\rm sun\}\$ and above have more diffuse stellar mass outside 100 kpc than within 100 kpc, with power-law slopes of the radial mass density distribution as shallow as the dark matter's ( \$-3.5 {\textless} \alpha\_\{\rm 3D\} {\textless} -3\$). Total halo mass is a very good predictor of stellar mass, and vice versa: at \$z=0\$, the 3D stellar mass measured within 30 kpc scales as \$\propto (M\_\{\rm 500c\}){\textasciicircum}\{0.49\}\$ with a \$\sim 0.12\$ dex scatter. This is possibly too steep in comparison to the available observational constraints, even though the abundance of TNG less massive galaxies (\${\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}M\_\{\rm sun\}\$ in stars) is in good agreement with the measured galaxy stellar mass functions at recent epochs. The 3D sizes of massive galaxies fall too on a tight (\$\sim\$0.16 dex scatter) power-law relation with halo mass, with \$r{\textasciicircum}\{\rm stars\}\_\{\rm 0.5\} \propto (M\_\{\rm 500c\}){\textasciicircum}\{0.53\}\$. Even more fundamentally, halo mass alone is a good predictor for the whole stellar mass profiles beyond the inner few kpc, and we show how on average these can be precisely recovered given a single mass measurement of the galaxy or its halo.},

By comparing the clustering of galaxies measured in the 300 Mpc TNG box (TNG300) with that predicted by the standard (``basic'') HOD model, we find that, on average, the ``basic'' HOD model underpredicts the real-space correlation function in the TNG300 box by \$\sim\$ 15\\% on scales of \$1 \ \{\rm Mpc\}/h {\textless} r {\textless} 20 \ \{\rm Mpc\}/h\$, which is well beyond the target precision demanded of next-generation galaxy redshift surveys. We perform several tests to establish the robustness of our findings to systematic effects, including the effect of finite box size and the choice of halo finder. In our exploration of ``secondary'' parameters with which to augment the ``basic'' HOD, we find that the local environment of the halo, the velocity dispersion anisotropy, \$\beta\$, and the product of the half-mass radius and the velocity dispersion, \$\sigma{\textasciicircum}2 R\_\{\rm halfmass\}\$, are the three most effective measures of assembly bias that help reconcile the ``basic'' HOD-predicted clustering with that in TNG300. In addition, we test other halo properties such as halo spin, formation epoch and halo concentration. We also find that at fixed halo mass, galaxies in one type of environment cluster differently from galaxies in another. We demonstrate that a more complete model of the galaxy-halo connection can be constructed if we combine both mass and local environment information about the halo.},

Deeper DECaLS images (r=23.6 vs. r=22.2 from SDSS) reveal spiral arms, weak bars, and tidal features not previously visible in SDSS imaging. To best exploit the greater depth of DECaLS images, volunteers select from a new set of answers designed to improve our sensitivity to mergers and bars. Galaxy Zoo volunteers provide 7.5 million individual classifications over 314,000 galaxies. 140,000 galaxies receive at least 30 classifications, sufficient to accurately measure detailed morphology like bars, and the remainder receive approximately 5. All classifications are used to train an ensemble of Bayesian convolutional neural networks (a state-of-the-art deep learning method) to predict posteriors for the detailed morphology of all 314,000 galaxies. When measured against confident volunteer classifications, the networks are approximately 99\% accurate on every question. Morphology is a fundamental feature of every galaxy; our human and machine classifications are an accurate and detailed resource for understanding how galaxies evolve.},

	abstract = {This paper presents SimCLR: a simple framework for contrastive learning of visual representations. We simplify recently proposed contrastive self-supervised learning algorithms without requiring specialized architectures or a memory bank. In order to understand what enables the contrastive prediction tasks to learn useful representations, we systematically study the major components of our framework. We show that (1) composition of data augmentations plays a critical role in defining effective predictive tasks, (2) introducing a learnable nonlinear transformation between the representation and the contrastive loss substantially improves the quality of the learned representations, and (3) contrastive learning benefits from larger batch sizes and more training steps compared to supervised learning. By combining these findings, we are able to considerably outperform previous methods for self-supervised and semi-supervised learning on ImageNet. A linear classifier trained on self-supervised representations learned by SimCLR achieves 76.5\% top-1 accuracy, which is a 7\% relative improvement over previous state-of-the-art, matching the performance of a supervised ResNet-50. When fine-tuned on only 1\% of the labels, we achieve 85.8\% top-5 accuracy, outperforming AlexNet with 100X fewer labels.},

	abstract = {A large-scale hydrodynamical cosmological simulation, Horizon-AGN, is used to investigate the alignment between the spin of galaxies and the cosmic filaments above redshift 1.2. The analysis of more than 150 000 galaxies per time step in the redshift range 1.2{\textless}z{\textless}1.8 with morphological diversity shows that the spin of low-mass blue galaxies is preferentially aligned with their neighbouring filaments, while high-mass red galaxies tend to have a perpendicular spin. The reorientation of the spin of massive galaxies is provided by galaxy mergers, which are significant in their mass build-up. We find that the stellar mass transition from alignment to misalignment happens around 3.10{\textasciicircum}10 M\_sun. Galaxies form in the vorticity-rich neighbourhood of filaments, and migrate towards the nodes of the cosmic web as they convert their orbital angular momentum into spin. The signature of this process can be traced to the properties of galaxies, as measured relative to the cosmic web. We argue that a strong source of feedback such as active galactic nuclei is mandatory to quench in situ star formation in massive galaxies and promote various morphologies. It allows mergers to play their key role by reducing post-merger gas inflows and, therefore, keeping spins misaligned with cosmic filaments.},

	abstract = {The cosmic web is the largest scale manifestation of the anisotropic gravitational collapse of matter. It represents the transitional stage between linear and non-linear structures and contains easily accessible information about the early phases of structure formation processes. Here we investigate the characteristics and the time evolution of morphological components since. Our analysis involves the application of the NEXUS Multiscale Morphology Filter (MMF) technique, predominantly its NEXUS+ version, to high resolution and large volume cosmological simulations. We quantify the cosmic web components in terms of their mass and volume content, their density distribution and halo populations. We employ new analysis techniques to determine the spatial extent of filaments and sheets, like their total length and local width. This analysis identifies cluster and filaments as the most prominent components of the web. In contrast, while voids and sheets take most of the volume, they correspond to underdense environments and are devoid of group-sized and more massive haloes. At early times the cosmos is dominated by tenuous filaments and sheets, which, during subsequent evolution, merge together, such that the present day web is dominated by fewer, but much more massive, structures. The analysis of the mass transport between environments clearly shows how matter flows from voids into walls, and then via filaments into cluster regions, which form the nodes of the cosmic web. We also study the properties of individual filamentary branches, to find long, almost straight, filaments extending to distances larger than 100Mpc/h. These constitute the bridges between massive clusters, which seem to form along approximatively straight lines.},

	abstract = {We present clustering analysis results from 10,381 Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) at z{\textasciitilde} 4-7, identified in the Hubble legacy deep imaging and new complimentary large-area Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam data. We measure the angular correlation functions (ACFs) of these LBGs at z{\textasciitilde}4, 5, 6, and 7, and fit these measurements using halo occupation distribution (HOD) models that provide an estimate of halo masses, M\_h{\textasciitilde}(1-20)x10{\textasciicircum}11 Msun. Our M\_h estimates agree with those obtained by previous clustering studies in a UV-magnitude vs. M\_h plane, and allow us to calculate stellar-to-halo mass ratios (SHMRs) of LBGs. By comparison with the z{\textasciitilde}0 SHMR, we identify evolution of the SHMR from z{\textasciitilde}0 to z{\textasciitilde}4, and z{\textasciitilde}4 to z{\textasciitilde}7 at the {\textgreater}98\% confidence levels. The SHMR decreases by a factor of {\textasciitilde}2 from z{\textasciitilde}0 to 4, and increases by a factor of {\textasciitilde}4 from z{\textasciitilde}4 to 7. We compare our SHMRs with results of a hydrodynamic simulation and a semi-analytic model, and find that these theoretical studies do not predict the SHMR increase from z{\textasciitilde}4 to 7. We obtain the baryon conversion efficiency (BCE) of LBGs at z{\textasciitilde}4, and find that the BCE increases with increasing dark matter halo mass. Finally, we compare our clustering+HOD estimates with results from abundance matching techniques, and conclude that the M\_h estimates of the clustering+HOD analyses agree with those of the simple abundance matching within a factor of 3, and that the agreement improves when using more sophisticated abundance matching techniques that include subhalos, incompleteness, and/or evolution in the star formation and stellar mass functions.},

We find that, with this change, the predicted LBG clustering increases significantly on quasi-linear scales (0.1 â¤ râ/âhâ1âMpc â¤ 10) compared to that in the linear halo bias model. This, in turn, results in an increase in the clustering of LBGs by an order of magnitude on angular scales 5 â¤ Î¸ â¤ 100âarcsec. Remarkably, the predictions of our new model on the whole remove the systematic discrepancy between the linear halo bias predictions and the observations. The correlation length and large-scale galaxy bias of LBGs are found to be significantly higher in the non-linear halo bias model than in the linear halo bias model. The resulting two-point correlation function retains an approximate power-law form in contrast with that computed using the linear halo bias theory. We also find that the non-linear clustering of LBGs increases with increasing luminosity and redshift. Our work emphasizes the importance of using non-linear halo bias in order to model the clustering of high-z galaxies to probe the physics of galaxy formation and extract cosmological parameters reliably.},

	abstract = {Here we provide the most comprehensive determinations of the rest-frame UV luminosity function (LF) available to date with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) at z {\textasciitilde} 2-9. Essentially all of the noncluster extragalactic legacy fields are utilized, including the Hubble Ultra Deep Field, the Hubble Frontier Fields parallel fields, and all five CANDELS fields, for a total survey area of 1136 arcmin2. Our determinations include galaxies at z {\textasciitilde} 2-3 leveraging the deep HDUV, UVUDF, and ERS WFC3/UVIS observations available over an {\textasciitilde}150 arcmin2 area in the GOODS-North and GOODS-South regions. All together, our collective samples include {\textgreater}24,000 sources, {\textgreater}2.3Ã larger than previous selections with HST. We identify 5766, 6332, 7240, 3449, 1066, 601, 246, and 33 sources at z {\textasciitilde} 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, respectively. Combining our results with an earlier z {\textasciitilde} 10 LF determination by Oesch et al., we quantify the evolution of the UV LF. Our results indicate that there is (1) a smooth flattening of the faint-end slope Î± from Î± {\textasciitilde} -2.4 at z {\textasciitilde} 10 to Î± {\textasciitilde} -1.5 at z {\textasciitilde} 2, (2) minimal evolution in the characteristic luminosity M* at z â¥ 2.5, and (3) a monotonic increase in the normalization \$\{\mathrm\{log\}\}\_\{10\}\{\phi \}{\textasciicircum}\{* \}\$ from z {\textasciitilde} 10 to 2, which can be well described by a simple second-order polynomial, consistent with an "accelerated" evolution scenario. We find that each of these trends (from z {\textasciitilde} 10 to 2.5 at least) can be readily explained on the basis of the evolution of the halo mass function and a simple constant star formation efficiency model.},

	abstract = {In hierarchical cosmologies the evolution of galaxy clustering depends both on cosmological quantities such as Omega and Lambda, which determine how dark matter halos form and evolve, and on the physical processes - cooling, star formation and feedback - which drive the formation of galaxies within these merging halos. In this paper, we combine dissipationless cosmological N-body simulations and semi-analytic models of galaxy formation in order to study how these two aspects interact. We focus on the differences in clustering predicted for galaxies of differing luminosity, colour, morphology and star formation rate and on what these differences can teach us about the galaxy formation process. We show that a "dip" in the amplitude of galaxy correlations between z=0 and z=1 can be an important diagnostic. Such a dip occurs in low-density CDM models because structure forms early and dark matter halos of 10**12 solar masses, containing galaxies with luminosities around L*, are unbiased tracers of the dark matter over this redshift range; their clustering amplitude then evolves similarly to that of the dark matter. At higher redshifts bright galaxies become strongly biased and the clustering amplitude increases again. In high density models, structure forms late and bias evolves more rapidly. As a result, the clustering amplitude of L* galaxies remains constant from z=0 to 1. The strength of these effects is sensitive to sample selection. The dip is weaker for galaxies with lower star formation rates, redder colours, higher luminosities and earlier morphological types. We explain why this is the case and how it is related to the variation with redshift of the abundance and and environment of the observed galaxies. Studies of clustering evolution as a function of galaxy properties should place strong constraints on models.},

We use fast power spectrum estimators that are based on simple integrals over the real-space correlation functions, and show that they are practically unbiased over relevant angular frequency ranges. We test our full pipeline on numerical simulations that are tailored to KiDS and retrieve the input cosmology. By fitting different combinations of power spectra, we demonstrate that the three probes are internally consistent. For all probes combined, we obtain \$S\_8\equiv \sigma\_8 \sqrt\{\Omega\_\{\rm m\}/0.3\}=0.800\_\{-0.027\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.029\}\$, consistent with Planck and the fiducial KiDS-450 cosmic shear correlation function results. Marginalising over wide priors on the mean of the tomographic redshift distributions yields consistent results for \$S\_8\$ with an increase of \$28\\%\$ in the error. The combination of probes results in a \$26\\%\$ reduction in uncertainties of \$S\_8\$ over using the cosmic shear power spectra alone. The main gain from these additional probes comes through their constraining power on nuisance parameters, such as the galaxy intrinsic alignment amplitude or potential shifts in the redshift distributions, which are up to a factor of two better constrained compared to using cosmic shear alone, demonstrating the value of large-scale structure probe combination.},

To best exploit the greater depth of DECaLS images, volunteers select from a new set of answers designed to improve our sensitivity to mergers and bars. Galaxy Zoo volunteers provide 7.5 million individual classifications over 314,000 galaxies. 140,000 galaxies receive at least 30 classifications, sufficient to accurately measure detailed morphology like bars, and the remainder receive approximately 5. All classifications are used to train an ensemble of Bayesian convolutional neural networks (a state-of-the-art deep learning method) to predict posteriors for the detailed morphology of all 314,000 galaxies. When measured against confident volunteer classifications, the networks are approximately 99\% accurate on every question.

	abstract = {This paper presents SimCLR: a simple framework for contrastive learning of visual representations. We simplify recently proposed contrastive self-supervised learning algorithms without requiring specialized architectures or a memory bank. In order to understand what enables the contrastive prediction tasks to learn useful representations, we systematically study the major components of our framework. We show that (1) composition of data augmentations plays a critical role in defining effective predictive tasks, (2) introducing a learnable nonlinear transformation between the representation and the contrastive loss substantially improves the quality of the learned representations, and (3) contrastive learning benefits from larger batch sizes and more training steps compared to supervised learning. By combining these findings, we are able to considerably outperform previous methods for self-supervised and semi-supervised learning on ImageNet. A linear classifier trained on self-supervised representations learned by SimCLR achieves 76.5\% top-1 accuracy, which is a 7\% relative improvement over previous state-of-the-art, matching the performance of a supervised ResNet-50. When fine-tuned on only 1\% of the labels, we achieve 85.8\% top-5 accuracy, outperforming AlexNet with 100X fewer labels.},

	abstract = {We present a new model to describe the galaxyâdark matter connection across cosmic time, which unlike the popular subhalo abundance-matching technique is self-consistent in that it takes account of the facts that (1) subhalos are accreted at different times and (2) the properties of satellite galaxies may evolve after accretion. Using observations of galaxy stellar mass functions (SMFs) out to z â¼ 4, the conditional SMF at z â¼ 0.1 obtained from Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxy group catalogs, and the two-point correlation function (2PCF) of galaxies at z â¼ 0.1 as a function of stellar mass, we constrain the relation between galaxies and dark matter halos over the entire cosmic history from z â¼ 4 to the present. This relation is then used to predict the median assembly histories of different stellar mass components within dark matter halos (central galaxies, satellite galaxies, and halo stars). We also make predictions for the 2PCFs of high-z galaxies as function of stellar mass. Our main findings are the following: (1) Our model reasonably fits all data within the observational uncertainties, indicating that the ÎCDM concordance cosmology is consistent with a wide variety of data regarding the galaxy population across cosmic time. (2) At low-z, the stellar mass of central galaxies increases with halo mass as M0.3 and Mâ³ 4.0 at the massive and low-mass ends, respectively. The ratio M*, c/M reveals a maximum of â¼0.03 at a halo mass M â¼ 1011.8 hâ1 Mâ, much lower than the universal baryon fraction (â¼0.17). At higher redshifts the maximum in M*, c/M remains close to â¼0.03, but shifts to higher halo mass. (3) The inferred timescale for the disruption of satellite galaxies is about the same as the dynamical friction timescale of their subhalos. (4) The stellar mass assembly history of central galaxies is completely decoupled from the assembly history of its host halo; the ratio M*, c/M initially increases rapidly with time until the halo mass reaches â¼1012 hâ1 Mâ, at which point M*, c/M â¼ 0.03. Once M â³ 1012 hâ1 Mâ, there is little growth in M*, c, causing the ratio M*, c/M to decline. In Milky Way (MW)-sized halos more than half of the central stellar mass is assembled at z â² 0.5. (5) In low-mass halos, the accretion of satellite galaxies contributes little to the formation of their central galaxies, indicating that most of their stars must have formed in situ. In massive halos more than half of the stellar mass of the central galaxy has to be formed in situ, and the accretion of satellites can only become significant at z â² 2. (6) The total mass in halo stars is more than twice that of the central galaxy in massive halos, but less than 10\% of M*, c in MW-sized halos. (7) The 2PCFs of galaxies on small scales hold important information regarding the evolution of satellite galaxies, which at high-z is predicted to be much steeper than at low-z, especially for more massive galaxies. We discuss various implications of our findings regarding the formation and evolution of galaxies in a ÎCDM cosmology.},

We consider the effects of a wide range of uncertainties on our results, including those affecting stellar masses, SFRs, and the halo mass function at the heart of our analysis. As they are relevant to our method, we also present new calibrations of the dark matter halo mass function, halo mass accretion histories, and halo-subhalo merger rates out to z = 8. We also provide new compilations of CSFRs and SSFRs; more recent measurements are now consistent with the buildup of the cosmic stellar mass density at all redshifts. Implications of our work include: halos near 1012 M â are the most efficient at forming stars at all redshifts, the baryon conversion efficiency of massive halos drops markedly after z {\textasciitilde} 2.5 (consistent with theories of cold-mode accretion), the ICL for massive galaxies is expected to be significant out to at least z {\textasciitilde} 1-1.5, and dwarf galaxies at low redshifts have higher stellar mass to halo mass ratios than previous expectations and form later than in most theoretical models. Finally, we provide new fitting formulae for SFHs that are more accurate than the standard declining tau model. Our approach places a wide variety of observations relating to the SFH of galaxies into a self-consistent framework based on the modern understanding of structure formation in ÎCDM.

We derive angular correlation functions (ACFs) for the HSC LBGs with unprecedentedly high statistical accuracies at zÂ â¼Â 4â6, and compare them with the halo occupation distribution (HOD) models. We clearly identify significant ACF excesses in 10â³Â \&lt;Â Î¸Â \&lt;Â 90â³, the transition scale between one- and two-halo terms, suggestive of the existence of the non-linear halo bias effect. Combining the HOD models and previous clustering measurements of faint LBGs at zÂ â¼Â 4â7, we investigate the dark matter halo mass (Mh) of the zÂ â¼Â 4â7 LBGs and its correlation with various physical properties including the star formation rate (SFR), the stellar-to-halo mass ratio (SHMR), and the dark matter accretion rate (\$\skew4\dot\{M\}\_\{\,\rm h\}\$) over a wide mass range of Mh/Mâ Â =Â 4Â ÃÂ 1010â4Â ÃÂ 1012.

This weak evolution suggests that the SFR\$/\skew4\dot\{M\}\_\{\,\rm h\}\$âMh relation is a fundamental relation in high-redshift galaxy formation whose star formation activities are regulated by the dark matter mass assembly. Assuming this fundamental relation, we calculate the cosmic star formation rate densities (SFRDs) over zÂ =Â 0â10 (a.k.a. the MadauâLilly plot). The cosmic SFRD evolution based on the fundamental relation agrees with the one obtained by observations, suggesting that the cosmic SFRD increase from zÂ â¼Â 10 to 4Â âÂ 2 (decrease from zÂ â¼Â 4â2 to 0) is mainly driven by the increase of the halo abundance (the decrease of the accretion rate).},

The dark matter halo accretion rate is obtained from a high-resolution N-body simulation in order to capture the stochasticity in accretion histories and to obtain spatial information for the distribution of galaxies. The halo mass dependence of the star formation efficiency is calibrated at z = 4 by requiring a match to the observed UV LF at this redshift. The model then correctly predicts the observed UV LF at z = 5â10. We present predictions for the UV luminosity and stellar mass functions, JWST number counts, and SFHs. In particular, we find a stellar-to-halo mass relation at z = 4â10 that scales with halo mass at Mh {\textless} 1011 Mâ as Mâ â Mh2, with a normalization that is higher than the relation inferred at z = 0. The average SFRs increase as a function of time to z = 4, although there is significant scatter around the average: about 6\% of the z = 4 galaxies show no significant mass growth. Using these SFHs, we present redshift-dependent UV-to-SFR conversion factors, mass return fractions, and mass-to-light ratios for different initial mass functions and metallicities, finding that current estimates of the cosmic SFR density at z â¼ 10 may be overestimated by â¼0.1â0.2 dex.},

	abstract = {We present a new statistical method to determine the relationship between the stellar masses of galaxies and the masses of their host dark matter haloes over the entire cosmic history from z â¼ 4 to the present. This multi-epoch abundance matching (MEAM) model self-consistently takes into account that satellite galaxies first become satellites at times earlier than they are observed. We employ a redshift-dependent parametrization of the stellar-to-halo-mass relation to populate haloes and subhaloes in the Millennium simulations with galaxies, requiring that the observed stellar mass functions at several redshifts are reproduced simultaneously. We show that physically meaningful growth of massive galaxies is consistent with these data only if observational mass errors are taken into account. Using merger trees extracted from the dark matter simulations in combination with MEAM, we predict the average assembly histories of galaxies, separating into star formation within the galaxies (in situ) and accretion of stars (ex situ). Our main results are the peak star formation efficiency decreases with redshift from 23 per cent at z = 0 to 9 per cent at z =4 while the corresponding halo mass increases from 1011.8 to 1012.5 Mâ. The star formation rate of central galaxies peaks at a redshift which depends on halo mass; for massive haloes this peak is at early cosmic times while for low-mass galaxies the peak has not been reached yet. In haloes similar to that of the Milky Way about half of the central stellar mass is assembled after z = 0.7. In low-mass haloes, the accretion of satellites contributes little to the assembly of their central galaxies, while in massive haloes more than half of the central stellar mass is formed ex situ with significant accretion of satellites at z {\textless} 2. We find that our method implies a cosmic star formation history and an evolution of specific star formation rates which are consistent with those inferred directly. We present convenient fitting functions for stellar masses, star formation rates and accretion rates as functions of halo mass and redshift.},

We assign a star formation rate to each dark matter halo based on its growth rate, which specifies how much baryonic material becomes available, and the instantaneous baryon conversion efficiency, which determines how efficiently this material is converted to stars, thereby capturing the baryonic physics. Satellites are quenched following the delayed-then-rapid model, and they are tidally disrupted once their subhalo has lost a significant fraction of its mass. The model is constrained with observed data extending out to high redshift. The empirical relations are very flexible, and the model complexity is increased only if required by the data, assessed by several model selection statistics. We find that for the same final halo mass galaxies can have very different star formation histories. Galaxies that are quenched at z = 0 typically have a higher peak star formation rate compared to their star-forming counterparts. EMERGE predicts stellar-to-halo mass ratios for individual galaxies and introduces scatter self-consistently. We find that at fixed halo mass, passive galaxies have a higher stellar mass on average. The intracluster mass in massive haloes can be up to eight times larger than the mass of the central galaxy. Clustering for star-forming and quenched galaxies is in good agreement with observational constraints, indicating a realistic assignment of galaxies to haloes.},

	abstract = {We estimate the galaxy stellar mass function and stellar mass density for star-forming and quiescent galaxies with 0.2 \&lt; z \&lt; 4. We construct a large, deep (K{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}s{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} \&lt; 24) sample of 220 000 galaxies selected using the new UltraVISTA DR1 data release. Our analysis is based on precise 30-band photometricredshifts. By comparing these photometric redshifts with 10,800 spectroscopic redshifts from the zCOSMOS bright and faint surveys, we find a precision of Ï{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Îz/(1 + z){\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 0.008 at i{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} \&lt; 22.5 and Ï{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Îz/(1 + z){\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 0.03 at 1.5 \&lt; z \&lt; 4. We derive the stellar mass function and correct for the Eddington bias. We find a mass-dependent evolution of the global and star-forming populations, with the low-mass end of the mass functions evolving more rapidly than the high-mass end. This mass-dependent evolution is a direct consequence of the star formation being "quenched" in galaxies more massive than â³ â³ 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}10.7 - 10.9{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}â³{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}â{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. For the mass function of the quiescent galaxies, we do not find any significant evolution of the high-mass end at z \&lt; 1; however we observe a clear flattening of the faint-end slope. From z {\textasciitilde} 3 to z {\textasciitilde} 1, the density of quiescent galaxies increases over the entire mass range. Their comoving stellar mass density increases by 1.6 dex between z {\textasciitilde} 3 and z {\textasciitilde} 1 and by less than 0.2 dex at z \&lt; 1. We infer the star formation history from the mass density evolution. This inferred star formation history is in excellent agreement with instantaneous star formation rate measurements at z \&lt; 1.5, while we find differences of 0.2 dex at z \&gt; 1.5 consistent with the expected uncertainties. We also develop a new method to infer the specific star formation rate from the mass function of star-forming galaxies. We find that the specific star formation rate of 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}10 - 10.5{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}â³{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}â{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} galaxies increases continuously in the redshift range 1 \&lt; z \&lt; 4. Finally, we compare our results with a semi-analytical model and find that these models overestimate the density of low mass quiescent galaxies by an order of magnitude, while the density of low-mass star-forming galaxies is successfully reproduced. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Based on data products from observations made with ESO Telescopes at the La Silla Paranal Observatory under ESO programme ID 179.A-2005 and on data products produced by TERAPIX and the Cambridge Astronomy Survey Unit on behalf of the UltraVISTA consortium.Catalogues are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr{\textless}/A{\textgreater} (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/556/A55"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/556/A55{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {We present far-infrared (FIR) photometry at 150 and 205 Î¼m of eight low-redshift starburst galaxies obtained with the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) ISOPHOT. Five of the eight galaxies are detected in both wave bands, and these data are used, in conjunction with IRAS archival photometry, to model the dust emission at Î»{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}40 Î¼m. The FIR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are best fitted by a combination of two modified Planck functions, with T{\textasciitilde}40-55 K (warm dust) and T{\textasciitilde}20-23 K (cool dust) and with a dust emissivity index É=2. The cool dust can be a major contributor to the FIR emission of starburst galaxies, representing up to 60\% of the total flux. This component is heated not only by the general interstellar radiation field, but also by the starburst itself. The cool dust mass is up to {\textasciitilde}150 times larger than the warm dust mass, bringing the gas-to-dust ratios of the starbursts in our sample close to Milky Way values, once rescaled for the appropriate metallicity. The ratio between the total dust FIR emission in the range 1-1000 Î¼m and the IRAS FIR emission in the range 40-120 Î¼m is {\textasciitilde}1.75, with small variations from galaxy to galaxy. This ratio is about 40\% larger than previously inferred from data at millimeter wavelengths. Although the galaxies in our sample are generally classified as ``UV bright,'' for four of them the UV energy emerging shortward of 0.2 Î¼m is less than 15\% of the FIR energy. On average, about 30\% of the bolometric flux is coming out in the UV-to-near-IR wavelength range; the rest is emitted in the FIR. Energy balance calculations show that the FIR emission predicted by the dust reddening of the UV-to-near-IR stellar emission is within a factor of {\textasciitilde}2 of the observed value in individual galaxies and within 20\% when averaged over a large sample. If our sample of local starbursts is representative of high-redshift (z{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}1), UV-bright, star-forming galaxies, these galaxies' FIR emission will be generally undetected in submillimeter surveys, unless (1) their bolometric luminosity is comparable to or larger than that of ultraluminous FIR galaxies and (2) their FIR SED contains a cool dust component.

	abstract = {We present a study of the morphological nature of redshift z{\textasciitilde}0.7 star-forming galaxies using a combination of HST ACS, GALEX, and ground-based images of the COSMOS field. Our sample consists of 8146 galaxies, 5777 of which are detected in the GALEX near-ultraviolet band (2310 Ã or {\textasciitilde}1360 Ã rest frame) down to a limiting magnitude of 25.5 (AB), and all of which have a brightness of F814W(HST){\textless}23 mag and photometric redshifts in the range 0.5520). We observe a bimodality in the galaxy population in asymmetry and in clumpiness, although the separation is most evident when either of those parameters is combined with a concentration-like parameter (C, G, or M20). We further show that this morphological bimodality has a strong correspondence with the FUV-g color bimodality and conclude that UV-optical color predominantly evolves concurrently with morphology. We observe many of the most star-forming galaxies to have morphologies approaching that of early-type galaxies, and we interpret this as evidence that strong starburst events are linked to bulge growth and constitute a process through which galaxies can be brought from the blue to the red sequence while simultaneously modifying their morphology accordingly. We conclude that the red sequence has continued growing at z{\textless}{\textasciitilde}0.7. We also observe z{\textasciitilde}0.7 galaxies to have physical properties similar to that of local galaxies, except for higher star formation rates. Whence we infer that the dimming of star-forming galaxies is responsible for most of the evolution in star formation rate density since that redshift, although our data are also consistent with a mild number evolution.

The Wide layer data cover about 300âdeg\${\textasciicircum}2\$ in all five broad-band filters (\$grizy\$) to the nominal survey exposure (10âmin in \$gr\$ and 20âmin in \$izy\$). Partially observed areas are also included in the release; about 1100âdeg\${\textasciicircum}2\$ is observed in at least one filter and one exposure. The median seeing in the i-band is \$\{0\_\{.\}{\textasciicircum}\{\prime \prime \}6\}\$, demonstrating the superb image quality of the survey. The Deep (26âdeg\${\textasciicircum}2\$) and UltraDeep (4âdeg\${\textasciicircum}2\$) data are jointly processed and the UltraDeep-COSMOS field reaches an unprecedented depth of \$i\sim 28\$ at \$5 \, \sigma\$ for point sources. In addition to the broad-band data, narrow-band data are also available in the Deep and UltraDeep fields. This release includes a major update to the processing pipeline, including improved sky subtraction, PSF modeling, object detection, and artifact rejection. The overall data quality has been improved, but this release is not without problems; there is a persistent deblender problem as well as new issues with masks around bright stars. The user is encouraged to review the issue list before utilizing the data for scientific explorations. All the image products as well as catalog products are available for download. The catalogs are also loaded into a database, which provides an easy interface for users to retrieve data for objects of interest. In addition to these main data products, detailed galaxy shape measurements withheld from Public Data ReleaseÂ 1 (PDR1) are now available to the community. The shape catalog is drawn from the S16A internal release, which has a larger area than PDR1 (160âdeg\${\textasciicircum}2\$). All products are available at the data release site, https://hsc-release.mtk.nao.ac.jp/.},

	abstract = {Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) is a wide-field imaging camera on the prime focus of the 8.2-m Subaru telescope on the summit of Mauna Kea in Hawaii. A team of scientists from Japan, Taiwan, and Princeton University is using HSC to carry out a 300-night multi-band imaging survey of the high-latitude sky. The survey includes three layers: the Wide layer will cover 1400 deg2 in five broad bands (grizy), with a 5 Ï point-source depth of r â 26. The Deep layer covers a total of 26 deg2 in four fields, going roughly a magnitude fainter, while the UltraDeep layer goes almost a magnitude fainter still in two pointings of HSC (a total of 3.5 deg2). Here we describe the instrument, the science goals of the survey, and the survey strategy and data processing. This paper serves as an introduction to a special issue of the Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, which includes a large number of technical and scientific papers describing results from the early phases of this survey.},

Our knowledge about star-forming galaxies at these epochs has dramatically advanced from increasingly complete population censuses and detailed views of individual galaxies. We highlight some of the key observational insights that influenced our current understanding of galaxy evolution in the equilibrium growth picture: \$\bullet\$ scaling relations between galaxy properties are fairly well established among massive galaxies at least out to z{\textasciitilde}2, pointing to regulating mechanisms already acting on galaxy growth; \$\bullet\$ resolved views reveal that gravitational instabilities and efficient secular processes within the gas- and baryon-rich galaxies at z{\textasciitilde}2 play an important role in the early build-up of galactic structure; \$\bullet\$ ever more sensitive observations of kinematics at z{\textasciitilde}2 are probing the baryon and dark matter budget on galactic scales and the links between star-forming galaxies and their likely descendants; \$\bullet\$ towards higher masses, massive bulges, dense cores, and powerful AGN and AGN-driven outflows are more prevalent and likely play a role in quenching star formation. We outline emerging questions and exciting prospects for the next decade with upcoming instrumentation, including the James Webb Space Telescope and the next generation of Extremely Large Telescopes.},

	abstract = {Aims: We study the dependence of galaxy clustering on luminosity and stellar mass at redshifts zË [0.2-1], using the first 10K redshifts from the zCOSMOS spectroscopic survey of the COSMOS field. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater}Methods: We measured the redshift-space correlation functions Î¾(r\_p,Ï) and Î¾(s) and the projected function, w\_p(r\_p) for subsamples covering different luminosity, mass, and redshift ranges. We explored and quantified in detail the observational selection biases from the flux-limited nature of the survey, using ensembles of realistic semi-analytic mock samples built from the Millennium simulation. We used the same mock data sets to carefully check our covariance and error estimate techniques, comparing the performances of methods based on the scatter in the mocks and on bootstrapping schemes. We finally compared our measurements to the cosmological model predictions from the mock surveys. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater}Results: At odds with other measurements at similar redshift and in the local Universe, we find a weak dependence of galaxy clustering on luminosity in all three redshift bins explored. A mild dependence on stellar mass is instead observed, in particular on small scales, which becomes particularly evident in the central redshift bin (0.5\&lt;z\&lt;0.8), where w\_p(r\_p) shows strong excess power on scales \&gt;1 h{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} Mpc. This is reflected in the shape of the full Î¾(r\_p,Ï) that we interpret as produced by dominating structures almost perpendicular to the line of sight in the survey volume. Comparing to zË 0 measurements, we do not see any significant evolution with redshift of the amplitude of clustering for bright and/or massive galaxies. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater}Conclusions: This is consistent with previous results and the standard picture in which the bias evolves more rapidly for the most massive haloes, which in turn host the highest-stellar-mass galaxies. At the same time, however, the clustering measured in the zCOSMOS 10K data at 0.5\&lt;z\&lt;1 for galaxies with log(M/M\_â)â¥ 10 is only marginally consistent with the predictions from the mock surveys. On scales larger than {\textasciitilde}2 h{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} Mpc, the observed clustering amplitude is compatible only with {\textasciitilde}1\% of the mocks. Thus, if the power spectrum of matter is ÎCDM with standard normalisation and the bias has no âunnaturalâ scale-dependence, this result indicates that COSMOS has picked up a particularly rare, {\textasciitilde}2-3Ï positive fluctuation in a volume of {\textasciitilde}10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}6{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} h{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} Mpc{\textasciicircum}3. These findings underline the need for larger surveys of the zË 1 Universe to appropriately characterise the level of structure at this epoch. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Based on observation at the European Southern Observatory (ESO) {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Very Large Telescope (VLT) under Large Program 175.A-0839. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Also based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, {\textless}P /{\textgreater}obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc.

	abstract = {Cosmic shear is a powerful method to constrain cosmology, provided that any systematic effects are under control. The intrinsic alignment of galaxies is expected to severely bias parameter estimates if not taken into account. We explore the potential of a joint analysis of tomographic galaxy ellipticity, galaxy number density, and ellipticity-number density cross-correlations to simultaneously constrain cosmology and self-calibrate unknown intrinsic alignment and galaxy bias contributions. We treat intrinsic alignments and galaxy biasing as free functions of scale and redshift and marginalise over the resulting parameter sets. Constraints on cosmology are calculated by combining the likelihoods from all two-point correlations between galaxy ellipticity and galaxy number density. The information required for these calculations is already available in a standard cosmic shear dataset. We include contributions to these functions from cosmic shear, intrinsic alignments, galaxy clustering and magnification effects. In a Fisher matrix analysis we compare our constraints with those from cosmic shear alone in the absence of intrinsic alignments. For a potential future large area survey, such as Euclid, the extra information from the additional correlation functions can make up for the additional free parameters in the intrinsic alignment and galaxy bias terms, depending on the flexibility in the models. For example, the Dark Energy Task Force figure of merit is recovered even when more than 100 free parameters are marginalised over. We find that the redshift quality requirements are similar to those calculated in the absence of intrinsic alignments.},

The analysis extends previous work in the following respects: (1) We explore the relation between the ellipticity pattern of the background galaxies and the projected density of foreground matter. This yields both useful statistical correlations and also an approximate method for directly imaging foreground mass concentrations. (2) We calculate angular power spectra, using the analogue of Limber's equation in the Fourier domain, as well as angular correlation functions. We find that there are some characteristic features of the ellipticity correlations that appear most clearly in the Fourier representation. (3) The analysis is valid for arbitrary evolution of P(k) and for an arbitrary distance distribution for the galaxies. We show that the size of the effect on very large scales is tightly constrained by microwave anisotropy limits, but that the density fluctuations inferred from observed peculiar motions suggest interestingly large effects at angular scales below about a degree. We compute angular power spectra and correlation functions for a number of illustrative models for P(k). We discuss methods for estimating the various statistics, estimate their statistical uncertainty, and discuss the feasibility of this test.},

The reliability of our photometric redshifts is lower for fainter objects: we find \sigma\_\{\Delta z/(1+z)\}=0.029, 0.043 and \eta=1.7\%, 5.4\% for samples selected at i'\_\{AB\}=17.5-22.5 and 22.5-24 respectively. We find that the photometric redshifts of starburst galaxies in our sample are less reliable: although these galaxies represent only 18\% of the spectroscopic sample they are responsible for 54\% of the catastrophic errors.

Halos are identified using the spherical overdensity algorithm, which finds the mass around isolated peaks in the density field such that the mean density is Delta times the background. We calibrate fitting functions for the large scale bias that are adaptable to any value of Delta we examine. We find a {\textasciitilde}6\% scatter about our best fit bias relation. Our fitting functions couple to the halo mass functions of Tinker et. al. (2008) such that bias of all dark matter is normalized to unity. We demonstrate that the bias of massive, rare halos is higher than that predicted in the modified ellipsoidal collapse model of Sheth, Mo, \& Tormen (2001), and approaches the predictions of the spherical collapse model for the rarest halos. Halo bias results based on friends-of-friends halos identified with linking length 0.2 are systematically lower than for halos with the canonical Delta=200 overdensity by {\textasciitilde}10\%. In contrast to our previous results on the mass function, we find that the universal bias function evolves very weakly with redshift, if at all. We use our numerical results, both for the mass function and the bias relation, to test the peak-background split model for halo bias. We find that the peak-background split achieves a reasonable agreement with the numerical results, but {\textasciitilde}20\% residuals remain, both at high and low masses.},

We find that all such profiles have the same shape, independent of the halo mass, the initial density fluctuation spectrum, and the values of the cosmological parameters. Spherically averaged equilibrium profiles are well fitted over two decades in radius by a simple formula originally proposed to describe the structure of galaxy clusters in a cold dark matter universe. In any particular cosmology, the two scale parameters of the fit, the halo mass and its characteristic density, are strongly correlated. Low-mass halos are significantly denser than more massive systems, a correlation that reflects the higher collapse redshift of small halos. The characteristic density of an equilibrium halo is proportional to the density of the universe at the time it was assembled. A suitable definition of this assembly time allows the same proportionality constant to be used for all the cosmologies that we have tested. We compare our results with previous work on halo density profiles and show that there is good agreement. We also provide a step-by-step analytic procedure, based on the Press-Schechter formalism, that allows accurate equilibrium profiles to be calculated as a function of mass in any hierarchical model.},

	abstract = {We propose a heuristic model that displays the main features of realistic theories for galaxy bias. We show that the low-order clustering statistics of the dark-matter distribution depend almost entirely on the locations and density profiles of dark-matter haloes. A hypothetical galaxy catalogue depends on (i) the efficiency of galaxy formation, as manifested by the halo occupation number -- the number of galaxies brighter than some sample limit contained in a halo of a given mass; (ii) the location of these galaxies within their halo. The first factor is constrained by the empirical luminosity function of groups. For the second factor, we assume that one galaxy marks the halo centre, with any remaining galaxies acting as satellites that trace the halo mass. These simple assumptions amount to a recipe for non-local bias, in which the probability of finding a galaxy is not a simple function of its local mass density. We have applied this prescription to some CDM models of current interest, and find that the predictions are close to the observed galaxy correlations for a flat \$\Omega=0.3\$ model (\$\Lambda\$CDM), but not for an \$\Omega=1\$ model with the same power spectrum (\$\tau\$CDM). This is an inevitable consequence of cluster normalization for the power spectra: cluster-scale haloes of given mass have smaller core radii for high \$\Omega\$, and hence display enhanced small-scale clustering. Finally, the pairwise velocity dispersion of galaxies in the \$\Lambda\$CDM model is lower than that of the mass, allowing cluster-normalized models to yield a realistic Mach number for the peculiar velocity field. This is largely due to the strong variation of galaxy-formation efficiency with halo mass that is required in this model.},

	abstract = {We investigate an analytic model to compute nonlinear power spectrum of dark matter, galaxies and their cross-correlation. The model is based on Press-Schechter halos, which cluster and have realistic dark matter profiles. The total power spectrum is a sum of two contributions, one from correlations betwen the halos and one from correlations within the same halo. We show that such a model can give dark matter power spectra which match well with the results of N-body simulations, provided that concentration parameter decreases with the halo mass. Galaxy power spectrum differs from dark matter power spectrum because pair weighted number of galaxies increases less rapidly than the halo mass, as predicted by theoretical models and observed in clusters. In this case the resulting power spectrum becomes a power law with the slope closed to the observed. Such a model also predicts a later onset of nonlinear clustering compared to the dark matter, which is needed to reconcile the CDM models with the data. Generic prediction of this model is that bias is scale dependent and nonmonotonic. For red or elliptical galaxies bias in power spectrum may be scale dependent even on very large scales. Our predictions for galaxy-dark matter correlations, which can be observed through the galaxy-galaxy lensing, show that these cannot be interpreted simply as an average halo profile of a typical galaxy, because different halo masses dominate at different scales and because larger halos host more than one galaxy. We discuss the prospects of using cross-correlations in combination with galaxy clustering to determine the dark matter power spectrum (ABRIDGED).},

By populating the halos of a cosmological N-body simulation using a variety of HOD models, we examine the sensitivity of different galaxy clustering statistics to properties of the HOD. The galaxy correlation function responds to different aspects of P(N{\textbar}M) on different scales. Obtaining the observed power-law form of xi(r) requires rather specific combinations of HOD parameters, implying a strong constraint on the physics of galaxy formation; the success of numerical and semi-analytic models in reproducing this form is entirely non-trivial. Other clustering statistics such as the galaxy-mass correlation function, the bispectrum, the void probability function, the pairwise velocity dispersion, and the group multiplicity function are sensitive to different combinations of HOD parameters and thus provide complementary information about galaxy bias. We outline a strategy for determining the HOD empirically from redshift survey data. This method starts from an assumed cosmological model, but we argue that cosmological and HOD parameters will have non-degenerate effects on galaxy clustering, so that a substantially incorrect cosmological model will not reproduce the observations for any choice of HOD. Empirical determinations of the HOD as a function of galaxy type from the 2dF and SDSS redshift surveys will provide a detailed target for theories of galaxy formation, insight into the origin of galaxy properties, and sharper tests of cosmological models.},

Despite the relatively small footprints of the observed fields, the data are an excellent proxy for the deep photometric datasets that will be acquired by LSST, and are therefore an ideal test bed for the analysis methods being implemented by the LSST DESC. We select a magnitude limited sample with \$i{\textless}24.5\$ and analyze it in four redshift bins covering \$0.15\lesssim z \lesssim1.5\$. We carry out a Fourier-space analysis of the two-point clustering of this sample, including all auto- and cross-correlations. We demonstrate the use of map-level deprojection methods to account for fluctuations in the galaxy number density caused by observational systematics. Through an HOD analysis, we place constraints on the characteristic halo masses of this sample, finding a good fit up to scales \$k\_\{\rm max\}=1\,\{\rm Mpc\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, including both auto- and cross-correlations. Our results show monotonically decreasing average halo masses, which can be interpreted in terms of the drop-out of red galaxies at high redshifts for a flux-limited sample. In terms of photometric redshift systematics, we show that additional care is needed in order to marginalize over uncertainties in the redshift distribution in galaxy clustering, and that these uncertainties can be constrained by including cross-correlations. We are able to make a \$\sim3\sigma\$ detection of lensing magnification in the HSC data. Our results are stable to variations in \$\sigma\_8\$ and \$\Omega\_c\$ and we find constraints that agree well with measurements from Planck and low-redshift probes. Finally, we use our pipeline to study the clustering of galaxies as a function of limiting flux, and provide a simple fitting function for the linear galaxy bias for magnitude limited samples as a function of limiting magnitude and redshift.

	abstract = {We present the clustering properties of low-\$z\$ \$(z\leq1.4)\$ galaxies selected by the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program Wide layer over \$145\$ deg\${\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$. The wide-field and multi-wavelength observation yields \$5,064,770\$ galaxies at \$0.3\leq z\leq1.4\$ with photometric redshifts and physical properties. This enables the accurate measurement of angular correlation functions and subsequent halo occupation distribution (HOD) analysis allows the connection between baryonic properties and dark halo properties. The fraction of less-massive satellite galaxies at \$z\lesssim1\$ is found to be almost constant at \$\sim20\\%\$, but it gradually decreases beyond \$M\_\{\star\} \sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{10.4\}h{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}M\_\{\odot\}\$. However, the abundance of satellite galaxies at \$z{\textgreater}1\$ is quite small even for less-massive galaxies due to the rarity of massive centrals at high-\$z\$. This decreasing trend is connected to the small satellite fraction of Lyman break galaxies at \$z{\textgreater}3\$. The stellar-to-halo mass ratios at \$0.3\leq z\leq1.4\$ are almost consistent with the predictions obtained using the latest empirical model; however, we identify small excesses from the theoretical model at the massive end. The pivot halo mass is found to be unchanged at \$10{\textasciicircum}\{11.9-12.1\}h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}M\_\{\odot\}\$ at \$0.3\leq z\leq1.4\$, and we systematically show that \$10{\textasciicircum}\{12\}h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}M\_\{\odot\}\$ is a universal pivot halo mass up to \$z\sim5\$ that is derived using only the clustering/HOD analyses. Nevertheless, halo masses with peaked instantaneous baryon conversion efficiencies are much smaller than the pivot halo mass regardless of a redshift, and the most efficient stellar-mass assembly is thought to be in progress in \$10{\textasciicircum}\{11.0-11.5\}h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}M\_\{\odot\}\$ dark haloes.},

	abstract = {We use a statistical approach to determine the relationship between the stellar masses of galaxies and the masses of the dark matter halos in which they reside. We obtain a parameterized stellar-to-halo mass (SHM) relation by populating halos and subhalos in an N-body simulation with galaxies and requiring that the observed stellar mass function be reproduced. We find good agreement with constraints from galaxy-galaxy lensing and predictions of semi-analytic models. Using this mapping, and the positions of the halos and subhalos obtained from the simulation, we find that our model predictions for the galaxy two-point correlation function (CF) as a function of stellar mass are in excellent agreement with the observed clustering properties in the SDSS at z=0. We show that the clustering data do not provide additional strong constraints on the SHM function and conclude that our model can therefore predict clustering as a function of stellar mass. We compute the conditional mass function, which yields the average number of galaxies with stellar masses in the range [m, m+dm] that reside in a halo of mass M. We study the redshift dependence of the SHM relation and show that, for low mass halos, the SHM ratio is lower at higher redshift. The derived SHM relation is used to predict the stellar mass dependent galaxy CF and bias at high redshift. Our model predicts that not only are massive galaxies more biased than low mass ones at all redshifts, but the bias increases more rapidly with increasing redshift for massive galaxies than for low mass ones. We present convenient fitting functions for the SHM relation as a function of redshift, the conditional mass function, and the bias as a function of stellar mass and redshift.},

	abstract = {In our modern understanding of galaxy formation, every galaxy forms within a dark matter halo. The formation and growth of galaxies over time is connected to the growth of the halos in which they form. The advent of large galaxy surveys as well as high-resolution cosmological simulations has provided a new window into the statistical relationship between galaxies and halos and its evolution. Here we define this galaxy-halo connection as the multi-variate distribution of galaxy and halo properties that can be derived from observations and simulations. This connection provides a key test of physical galaxy formation models; it also plays an essential role in constraints of cosmological models using galaxy surveys and in elucidating the properties of dark matter using galaxies. We review techniques for inferring the galaxy-halo connection and the insights that have arisen from these approaches. Some things we have learned are that galaxy formation efficiency is a strong function of halo mass; at its peak in halos around a pivot halo mass of 10{\textasciicircum}12 Msun, less than 20\% of the available baryons have turned into stars by the present day; the intrinsic scatter in galaxy stellar mass is small, less than 0.2 dex at a given halo mass above this pivot mass; below this pivot mass galaxy stellar mass is a strong function of halo mass; the majority of stars over cosmic time were formed in a narrow region around this pivot mass. We also highlight key open questions about how galaxies and halos are connected, including understanding the correlations with secondary properties and the connection of these properties to galaxy clustering.},

The HORIZON-AGN simulation is analysed at z{\textasciitilde}2 using the DISPERSE code to extract multi-scale cosmic filaments. We find that the dependency of galaxy properties on large-scale environment is mostly inherited from the (large-scale) environmental dependency of their host halo mass. When adopting a residual analysis that removes the host halo mass effect, we detect a direct and non-negligible influence of cosmic filaments. Proximity to filaments enhances the build-up of stellar mass, a result in agreement with previous studies. However, our multi-scale analysis also reveals that, at the edge of filaments, star formation is suppressed. In addition, we find clues for compaction of the stellar distribution at close proximity to filaments. We suggest that gas transfer from the outside to the inside of the haloes (where galaxies reside) becomes less efficient closer to filaments, due to high angular momentum supply at the vorticity-rich edge of filaments. This quenching mechanism may partly explain the larger fraction of passive galaxies in filaments, as inferred from observations at lower redshifts.},

The unique combination of size and highly complete stellar mass estimates in COSMOS allows us to determine the SHMR over a wide range of halo masses from \$z\sim0.2\$ to \$z\sim5\$. At \$z\sim 0.2\$ the ratio of stellar-to-halo mass content peaks at a characteristic halo mass \$M\_\{\rm h\} =10{\textasciicircum}\{12\} M\_\odot\$ and declines at higher and lower halo masses. This characteristic halo mass increases with redshift reaching \$M\_\{\rm h\} =10{\textasciicircum}\{12.5\} M\_\odot\$ at \$z\sim2.3\$ and remaining flat up to \$z=4\$. We considered the principal sources of uncertainty in our stellar mass measurements and also the variation in halo mass estimates in the literature. We show that our results are robust to these sources of uncertainty and explore likely explanation for differences between our results and those published in the literature. The steady increase in characteristic halo mass with redshift points to a scenario where cold gas inflows become progressively more important in driving star-formation at high redshifts but larger samples of massive galaxies are needed to rigorously test this hypothesis.},

We also find that environmental quenching efficiency grows with stellar mass and reaches \$\sim 60\\%\$ for massive galaxies at \$z\sim 0.5\$. The environmental quenching is also more efficient in comparison to the stellar mass quenching for low mass galaxies (\$\rm M \lesssim 10{\textasciicircum}\{10\} \rm \{M\}\_\odot\$) at low and intermediate redshifts (\$z\lesssim 1.2\$). Our findings concur thoroughly with the "over-consumption" quenching model where the termination of cool gas accretion (cosmological starvation) happens in an over-dense environment and the galaxy starts to consume its remaining gas reservoir in depletion time. The depletion time depends on the stellar mass and could explain the evolution of environmental quenching efficiency with the stellar mass.},

We adopt a sophisticated halo modeling approach to statistically divide our two populations into central and satellite galaxies. For central galaxies, we find that the normalization of the SHMR is greater for our passive population. Through the modeling of \$\Lambda\$ cold dark matter halo mass accretion histories, we show that this can only arise if the conversion of baryons into stars was more efficient at higher redshifts and additionally that passive galaxies can be plausibly explained as residing in halos with the highest formation redshifts (i.e., those with the lowest accretion rates) at a given halo mass. At a fixed stellar mass, satellite galaxies occupy host halos with a greater mass than central galaxies, and we find further that the fraction of passive galaxies that are satellites is higher than for the combined population. This, and our derived satellite quenching timescales, combined with earlier estimates from the literature, support dynamical/environmental mechanisms as the dominant process for satellite quenching at \$z\lesssim3\$.},

We discuss the quantitative effects of uncertainties in observed galaxy stellar mass functions (GSMFs) (including stellar mass estimates and counting uncertainties), halo mass functions (including cosmology and uncertainties from substructure), and the abundance matching technique used to link galaxies to halos (including scatter in this connection). Our analysis results in a robust estimate of the SM-HM relation and its evolution from z=0 to z=4. The shape and evolution are well constrained for z {\textless} 1. The largest uncertainties at these redshifts are due to stellar mass estimates; however, failure to account for scatter in stellar masses at fixed halo mass can lead to errors of similar magnitude in the SM-HM relation for central galaxies in massive halos. We also investigate the SM-HM relation to z=4, although the shape of the relation at higher redshifts remains fairly unconstrained when uncertainties are taken into account. These results will provide a powerful tool to inform galaxy evolution models. [Abridged]},

	abstract = {We develop a theoretical framework that combines measurements of galaxy-galaxy lensing, galaxy clustering, and the galaxy stellar mass function in a self-consistent manner. While considerable effort has been invested in exploring each of these probes individually, attempts to combine them are still in their infancy despite the potential of such combinations to elucidate the galaxy-dark matter connection, to constrain cosmological parameters, and to test the nature of gravity. In this paper, we focus on a theoretical model that describes the galaxy-dark matter connection based on standard halo occupation distribution techniques. Several key modifications enable us to extract additional parameters that determine the stellar-to-halo mass relation and to simultaneously fit data from multiple probes while allowing for independent binning schemes for each probe. In a companion paper, we demonstrate that the model presented here provides an excellent fit to galaxy-galaxy lensing, galaxy clustering, and stellar mass functions measured in the COSMOS survey from z=0.2 to z=1.0. We construct mock catalogs from numerical simulations to investigate the effects of sample variance and covariance on each of the three probes. Finally, we analyze and discuss how trends in each of the three observables impact the derived parameters of the model. In particular, we investigate the various features of the observed galaxy stellar mass function (low-mass slope, plateau, knee, and high-mass cut-off) and show how each feature is related to the underlying relationship between stellar and halo mass. We demonstrate that the observed plateau feature in the stellar mass function at Mstellar{\textasciitilde}2x10{\textasciicircum}10 Msun is due to the transition that occurs in the stellar-to-halo mass relation at Mhalo {\textasciitilde} 10{\textasciicircum}12 Msun from a low-mass power-law regime to a sub-exponential function at higher stellar mass.},

	abstract = {We study cosmic variance in deep high-redshift surveys and its influence on the determination of the luminosity function for high-redshift galaxies. For several survey geometries relevant for Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) instruments, we characterize the distribution of the galaxy number counts. This is obtained by means of analytic estimates via the two-point correlation function in extended Press-Schechter theory, as well as by using synthetic catalogs extracted from N-body cosmological simulations of structure formation. We adopt a simple luminosity-dark halo mass relation to investigate the effects of environment on the fitting of the luminosity function. We show that in addition to variations of the normalization of the luminosity function, a steepening of its slope is also expected in underdense fields, similar to what is observed within voids in the local universe. Therefore, to avoid introducing artificial biases, caution must be taken when attempting to correct for field underdensity, such as in the case of the HST UDF i-dropout sample, which exhibits a deficit of bright counts with respect to the average counts in GOODS. A public version of the cosmic variance calculator based on the two-point correlation function integration is available on the Web at STScI.},

	abstract = {The distribution in space and both the optical and radio luminosity functions of quasi-stellar radio sources are derived The derivation is based on quasi-stellar sources in the Revised 3C Catalogue, in which they have been identified and observed with a high degree of completeness down to magnitude around 18k. The redshifts are assumed to be cosmological. The distribution in space is found to be strongly non-uniform. The space density, in co-moving coordinates, is increasing with redshift z, such that at z = 1 the density is around 150 and 80 times the local (z = 0) density, for qo = 0 and qo = 1, respectively. This density increase corresponds to a N(S) relation quite {\textasciitilde}imi1ar to that exhibited by extragalactic radio sources. The optical luminosity function is relatively flat, i e., the numbers per magnitude depend little on the luminosity In contrast the radio luminosity function is rather steep, the number per magnitude increas- ing toward fainter radio luminosities by a factor of around three to four per magnitude. Extension of this radio luminosity function by 1{\textasciitilde} magnitude is sufficient to account for the Sandage-Luyten estimate of the sky density of quasi-stellar objects. The local (z = 0) density of quasi-stellar objects can then be estimated at 7 X 1O{\textasciitilde} and 12 X 1O-{\textasciitilde} Mpc3, for qo = 0 and qo = 1, respectively.

The data consist of 47 red-band INT Wide Field Camera CCD images, forming two widely separated fields of total areas 1.01 and 0.74deg{\textasciicircum}2. Galaxy clustering is detected with a high significance of {\textasciitilde}10sigma. Over the R=21 to 23.5 range of magnitude limits, the angular correlation functions approximately follow theta{\textasciicircum}-0.8 power laws at theta{\textgreater}5arcsec, with amplitudes consistent with previous surveys and best fitted by a luminosity evolution model in which galaxy clustering is approximately stable in proper coordinates (epsilon=0). Assuming the redshift distribution from our pure luminosity evolution (PLE) model and the present-day galaxy correlation radii from Loveday et al., we estimate the clustering evolution as epsilon\_0.02 - 0.31 +0.48 for both fields combined, or epsilon\_-0.29 - 0.27 +0.31 for the larger of the two fields which is thought to be the better in data quality. On the larger of our fields, omega(theta) at 2{\textless}=theta{\textless}=5 significantly exceeds a omega(theta){\textasciitilde}theta{\textasciicircum}-0.8 power law of the amplitude measured at theta{\textgreater}5arcsec. If this excess of close pairs is due to interacting and merging galaxies, we estimate that it is consistent with the local fraction of galaxies in close ({\textless}19h{\textasciicircum}-1kpc) pairs combined with a merger/interaction rate evolving as (1+z){\textasciicircum}m with m 2.01 -0.69 +0.52. We derive the hierarchical moments s\_3(theta) and s\_4(theta) from the counts-in-cells of the 18.5{\textless}=R{\textless}=23.5 galaxies. We find relatively steep slopes of approximately theta{\textasciicircum}-0.4 for s\_3(theta) and theta{\textasciicircum}-0.6 for s\_4(theta), similar to those of the hierarchical moments of 17{\textless}=B{\textless}=20 galaxies in the EDSGCS at comparable physical scales. The s\_3(theta) and s\_4(theta) of the 18.5{\textless}=R{\textless}=23.5 galaxies show only a small reduction in normalization relative to those of the less deep EDSGCS survey, consistent with the expectations from N-body simulations of the evolving mass distribution. This indicates there is little change in the mean linear or non-linear biasing of galaxies from z{\textasciitilde}0 to {\textasciitilde}1, and hence appears to favour luminosity evolution for galaxies over `transient starburst dwarf' models, and supports the interpretation of the stable galaxy clustering as evidence for a low-Omega universe.},

We show how our algorithm would scale in computing time and memory usage for future lensing surveys. We also apply the procedure to our Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) survey data, originally described by Jarvis et al.

	abstract = {The analysis of weak gravitational lensing in wide-field imaging surveys is considered to be a major cosmological probe of dark energy. Our capacity to constrain the dark energy equation of state relies on the accurate knowledge of the galaxy mean redshift \$\langle z \rangle\$. We investigate the possibility of measuring \$\langle z \rangle\$ with an accuracy better than \$0.002\,(1+z)\$, in ten tomographic bins spanning the redshift interval \$0.2{\textless}z{\textless}2.2\$, the requirements for the cosmic shear analysis of Euclid. We implement a sufficiently realistic simulation to understand the advantages, complementarity, but also shortcoming of two standard approaches: the direct calibration of \$\langle z \rangle\$ with a dedicated spectroscopic sample and the combination of the photometric redshift probability distribution function (zPDF) of individual galaxies. We base our study on the Horizon-AGN hydrodynamical simulation that we analyse with a standard galaxy spectral energy distribution template-fitting code. Such procedure produces photometric redshifts with realistic biases, precision and failure rate. We find that the Euclid current design for direct calibration is sufficiently robust to reach the requirement on the mean redshift, provided that the purity level of the spectroscopic sample is maintained at an extremely high level of \${\textgreater}99.8\\%\$. The zPDF approach could also be successful if we debias the zPDF using a spectroscopic training sample. This approach requires deep imaging data, but is weakly sensitive to spectroscopic redshift failures in the training sample. We improve the debiasing method and confirm our finding by applying it to real-world weak-lensing data sets (COSMOS and KiDS+VIKING-450).},

We select them in the near-IR bands of the COSMOS2015 catalogue, which includes ultra-deep photometry from UltraVISTA-DR2, SPLASH, and Subaru/Hyper-SuprimeCam. At \$z{\textgreater}2.5\$ we use new precise photometric redshifts with error \$\sigma\_z=0.03(1+z)\$ and an outlier fraction of \$12\\%\$, estimated by means of the unique spectroscopic sample of COSMOS. The increased exposure time in the DR2, along with our panchromatic detection strategy, allow us to improve the stellar mass completeness at high \$z\$ with respect to previous UltraVISTA catalogues. We also identify passive galaxies through a robust colour-colour selection, extending their SMF estimate up to \$z=4\$. Our work provides a comprehensive view of galaxy stellar mass assembly between \$z=0.1\$ and 6, for the first time using consistent estimates across the entire redshift range. We fit these measurements with a Schechter function, correcting for Eddington bias. We compare the SMF fit with the halo mass function predicted from \$\Lambda\$CDM simulations. We find that at \$z{\textgreater}3\$ both functions decline with a similar slope in the high-mass end. This feature could be explained assuming that the mechanisms that quench star formation in massive haloes become less effective at high redshift; however further work needs to be done to confirm this scenario. Concerning the SMF low-mass end, it shows a progressive steepening as moving towards higher redshifts, with \$\alpha\$ decreasing from \$-1.47\_\{-0.02\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.02\}\$ at \$z\simeq0.1\$ to \$-2.11\_\{-0.13\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.30\}\$ at \$z\simeq5\$. This slope depends on the characterisation of the observational uncertainties, which is crucial to properly remove the Eddington bias. We show that there is currently no consensus on the method to quantify such errors: different error models result in different best-fit Schechter parameters. [Abridged]},

We investigate the total MF and the contribution of ETGs and LTGs, defined by different criteria (SED, morphology or star formation). We unveil a galaxy bimodality in the global MF, better represented by 2 Schechter functions dominated by ETGs and LTGs, respectively. For the global population we confirm that low-mass galaxies number density increases later and faster than for massive galaxies. We find that the MF evolution at intermediate-low values of Mstar (logM{\textless}10.6) is mostly explained by the growth in stellar mass driven by smoothly decreasing star formation activities. The low residual evolution is consistent with {\textasciitilde}0.16 merger per galaxy per Gyr (of which fewer than 0.1 are major). We find that ETGs increase in number density with cosmic time faster for decreasing Mstar, with a median "building redshift" increasing with mass, in contrast with hierarchical models. For LTGs we find that the number density of blue or spiral galaxies remains almost constant from z{\textasciitilde}1. Instead, the most extreme population of active star forming galaxies is rapidly decreasing in number density. We suggest a transformation from blue active spirals of intermediate mass into blue quiescent and successively (1-2 Gyr after) into red passive types. The complete morphological transformation into red spheroidals, required longer time-scales or follows after 1-2 Gyr. A continuous replacement of blue galaxies is expected by low-mass active spirals growing in stellar mass. We estimate that on average {\textasciitilde}25\% of blue galaxies is transforming into red per Gyr for logM{\textless}11. We conclude that the build-up of galaxies and ETGs follows the same downsizing trend with mass as the formation of their stars, converse to the trend predicted by current SAMs. We expect a negligible evolution of the global Galaxy Baryonic MF.},

	abstract = {We present the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) to redshift z â 1, based on the analysis of about 8500 galaxies with I \&lt; 22.5 (AB mag) over 1.4 deg{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}, which are part of the zCOSMOS-bright 10k spectroscopic sample. We investigate the total GSMF, as well as the contributions of early- and late-type galaxies (ETGs and LTGs, respectively), defined by different criteria (broad-band spectral energy distribution, morphology, spectral properties, or star formation activities). We unveil a galaxy bimodality in the global GSMF, whose shape is more accurately represented by 2 Schechter functions, one linked to the ETG and the other to the LTG populations. For the global population, we confirm a mass-dependent evolution (âmass-assembly downsizingâ), i.e., galaxy number density increases with cosmic time by a factor of two between z = 1 and z = 0 for intermediate-to-low mass (log (â³/â³{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}â{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) {\textasciitilde} 10.5) galaxies but less than 15\% for log(â³/â³{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}â{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) \&gt; 11. We find that the GSMF evolution at intermediate-to-low values of â³ (log (â³/â³{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}â{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) \&lt; 10.6) is mostly explained by the growth in stellar mass driven by smoothly decreasing star formation activities, despite the redder colours predicted in particular at low redshift. The low residual evolution is consistent, on average, with {\textasciitilde}0.16 merger per galaxy per Gyr (of which fewer than 0.1 are major), with a hint of a decrease with cosmic time but not a clear dependence on the mass. From the analysis of different galaxy types, we find that ETGs, regardless of the classification method, increase in number density with cosmic time more rapidly with decreasing M, i.e., follow a top-down building history, with a median âbuilding redshiftâ increasing with mass (z \&gt; 1 for log(â³/â³{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}â{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) \&gt; 11), in contrast to hierarchical model predictions. For LTGs, we find that the number density of blue or spiral galaxies with log(â³/â³{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}â{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) \&gt; 10 remains almost constant with cosmic time from z {\textasciitilde} 1. Instead, the most extreme population of star-forming galaxies (with high specific star formation), at intermediate/high-mass, rapidly decreases in number density with cosmic time. Our data can be interpreted as a combination of different effects. Firstly, we suggest a transformation, driven mainly by SFH, from blue, active, spiral galaxies of intermediate mass to blue quiescent and subsequently (1-2 Gyr after) red, passive types of low specific star formation. We find an indication that the complete morphological transformation, probably driven by dynamical processes, into red spheroidal galaxies, occurred on longer timescales or followed after 1-2 Gyr. A continuous replacement of blue galaxies is expected to be accomplished by low-mass active spirals increasing their stellar mass. We estimate the growth rate in number and mass density of the red galaxies at different redshifts and masses. The corresponding fraction of blue galaxies that, at any given time, is transforming into red galaxies per Gyr, due to the quenching of their SFR, is on average {\textasciitilde}25\% for log(â³/â³{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}â{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) \&lt; 11. We conclude that the build-up of galaxies and in particular of ETGs follows the same downsizing trend with mass (i.e. occurs earlier for high-mass galaxies) as the formation of their stars and follows the converse of the trend predicted by current SAMs. In this scenario, we expect there to be a negligible evolution of the galaxy baryonic mass function (GBMF) for the global population at all masses and a decrease with cosmic time in the GBMF for the blue galaxy population at intermediate-high masses. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Based on data obtained with the European Southern Observatory Very Large Telescope, Paranal, Chile, program 175.A-0839.},

	abstract = {We present the COSMOS2015 catalog which contains precise photometric redshifts and stellar masses for more than half a million objects over the 2deg\${\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$ COSMOS field. Including new \$YJHK\_\{\rm s\}\$ images from the UltraVISTA-DR2 survey, \$Y\$-band from Subaru/Hyper-Suprime-Cam and infrared data from the Spitzer Large Area Survey with the Hyper-Suprime-Cam Spitzer legacy program, this near-infrared-selected catalog is highly optimized for the study of galaxy evolution and environments in the early Universe. To maximise catalog completeness for bluer objects and at higher redshifts, objects have been detected on a \$\chi{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$ sum of the \$YJHK\_\{\rm s\}\$ and \$z{\textasciicircum}\{++\}\$ images. The catalog contains \$\sim 6\times 10{\textasciicircum}5\$ objects in the 1.5 deg\${\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$ UltraVISTA-DR2 region, and \$\sim 1.5\times 10{\textasciicircum}5\$ objects are detected in the "ultra-deep stripes" (0.62 deg\${\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$) at \$K\_\{\rm s\}\leq 24.7\$ (3\$\sigma\$, 3", AB magnitude). Through a comparison with the zCOSMOS-bright spectroscopic redshifts, we measure a photometric redshift precision of \$\sigma\_\{\Delta z/(1+z\_s)\}\$ = 0.007 and a catastrophic failure fraction of \$\eta=0.5\$\%. At \$3{\textless}z{\textless}6\$, using the unique database of spectroscopic redshifts in COSMOS, we find \$\sigma\_\{\Delta z/(1+z\_s)\}\$ = 0.021 and \$\eta=13.2\\% \$. The deepest regions reach a 90\\% completeness limit of 10\${\textasciicircum}\{10\}M\_\odot\$ to \$z=4\$. Detailed comparisons of the color distributions, number counts, and clustering show excellent agreement with the literature in the same mass ranges. COSMOS2015 represents a unique, publicly available, valuable resource with which to investigate the evolution of galaxies within their environment back to the earliest stages of the history of the Universe. The COSMOS2015 catalog is distributed via anonymous ftp (ftp://ftp.iap.fr/pub/from\_users/hjmcc/COSMOS2015/) and through the usual astronomical archive systems (CDS, ESO Phase 3, IRSA).},

	abstract = {We present a new model for computing the spectral evolution of stellar populations at ages between 1 Ã 105 and 2 Ã 1010 yr at a resolution of 3 Ã across the whole wavelength range from 3200 to 9500 Ã for a wide range of metallicities. These predictions are based on a newly available library of observed stellar spectra. We also compute the spectral evolution across a larger wavelength range, from 91 Ã to 160 Î¼m, at lower resolution. The model incorporates recent progress in stellar evolution theory and an observationally motivated prescription for thermally pulsing stars on the asymptotic giant branch. The latter is supported by observations of surface brightness fluctuations in nearby stellar populations. We show that this model reproduces well the observed optical and near-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams of Galactic star clusters of various ages and metallicities. Stochastic fluctuations in the numbers of stars in different evolutionary phases can account for the full range of observed integrated colours of star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds. The model reproduces in detail typical galaxy spectra from the Early Data Release (EDR) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We exemplify how this type of spectral fit can constrain physical parameters such as the star formation history, metallicity and dust content of galaxies. Our model is the first to enable accurate studies of absorption-line strengths in galaxies containing stars over the full range of ages. Using the highest-quality spectra of the SDSS EDR, we show that this model can reproduce simultaneously the observed strengths of those Lick indices that do not depend strongly on element abundance ratios. The interpretation of such indices with our model should be particularly useful for constraining the star formation histories and metallicities of galaxies.},

	abstract = {We describe a new program for determining photometric redshifts, dubbed EAZY. The program is optimized for cases where spectroscopic redshifts are not available, or only available for a biased subset of the galaxies. The code combines features from various existing codes: it can fit linear combinations of templates, it includes optional flux- and redshift-based priors, and its user interface is modeled on the popular HYPERZ code. A novel feature is that the default template set, as well as the default functional forms of the priors, are not based on (usually highly biased) spectroscopic samples, but on semi-analytical models. Furthermore, template mismatch is addressed by a novel rest-frame template error function. This function gives different wavelength regions different weights, and ensures that the formal redshift uncertainties are realistic. We introduce a redshift quality parameter, Q\_z, that provides a robust estimate of the reliability of the photometric redshift estimate. Despite the fact that EAZY is not "trained" on spectroscopic samples, the code (with default parameters) performs very well on existing public datasets. For K-selected samples in CDF-South and other deep fields we find a 1-sigma scatter in dz/(1+z) of 0.034, and we provide updated photometric redshift catalogs for the FIRES, MUSYC, and FIREWORKS surveys.},

This is consistent with galaxy formation models, whereby infalling satellite galaxies are preferentially stripped of their dark matter. We find consistent results with similar uncertainties when comparing constraints from a standard azimuthally averaged galaxy-galaxy lensing analysis and a two-dimensional likelihood analysis of the full shear field. As the latter approach is somewhat biased due to the lens incompleteness and as it does not provide any improvement to the precision when applied to actual data, we conclude that stacked tangential shear measurements are best-suited for studies of the galaxy-halo connection.},

It is still unclear whether this trend originates from the size growth of individual galaxies (via, e.g., mergers and/or AGN feedback) or from the inclusion of larger galaxies entering the selection at later epochs (progenitor bias). We here build a data-driven, flexible theoretical framework to probe the structural evolution of MGs. We assign galaxies to dark matter haloes via stellar mass-halo mass (SMHM) relations with varying high-mass slopes and scatters \$\sigma\_\{\rm SMHM\}\$ in stellar mass at fixed halo mass, and assign sizes to galaxies using an empirically-motivated, constant and linear relationship between \$R\_e\$ and the host dark matter halo radius \$R\_h\$. We find that: 1) the fast mean size growth of MGs is well reproduced independently of the shape of the input SMHM relation; 2) the numbers of compact MGs grow steadily until \$z\gtrsim2\$ and fall off at lower redshifts, suggesting a lesser role of progenitor bias at later epochs; 3) a time-independent scatter \$\sigma\_\{\rm SMHM\}\$ is consistent with a scenario in which compact starforming MGs transition into quiescent MGs in a few \$10{\textasciicircum}8\$yr with a negligible structural evolution during the compact phase, while a scatter increasing at high redshift implies significant size growth during the starforming phase. A robust measurement of the size function of MGs at high redshift can set strong constraints on the scatter of the SMHM relation and, by extension, on models of galaxy evolution.},

Weak lensing measurements from HSC enable measurements at fixed halo mass and provide constraints on the strength and impact of feedback at different halo mass scales. We compare the stellar mass function (SMF) and the Stellar-to-Halo Mass Relation (SHMR) at various radii and show that the radius at which the comparison is performed is important. In general, Illustris and TNG100 display steeper values of \$\alpha\$ where \$M\_\{\star\}\propto M\_\{\rm vir\}{\textasciicircum}\{\alpha\}\$. These differences are more pronounced for Illustris than for TNG100 and in the inner rather than outer regions of galaxies. Differences in the inner regions may suggest that TNG100 is too efficient at quenching in-situ star formation at \$M\_\{\rm vir\}\simeq10{\textasciicircum}\{13\} M\_\{\odot\}\$ but not efficient enough at \$M\_\{\rm vir\}\simeq10{\textasciicircum}\{14\} M\_\{\odot\}\$. The outer stellar masses are in excellent agreement with our observations at \$M\_\{\rm vir\}\simeq10{\textasciicircum}\{13\} M\_\{\odot\}\$, but both Illustris and TNG100 display excess outer mass as \$M\_\{\rm vir\}\simeq10{\textasciicircum}\{14\} M\_\{\odot\}\$ (by {\textasciitilde}0.25 and {\textasciitilde}0.12 dex, respectively). We argue that reducing stellar growth at early times in \$M\_\star \sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{9-10\} M\_\{\odot\}\$ galaxies would help to prevent excess ex-situ growth at this mass scale. The Ponos simulations do not implement AGN feedback and display an excess mass of {\textasciitilde}0.5 dex at \$r{\textless}30\$ kpc compared to HSC which is indicative of over-cooling and excess star formation in the central regions. Joint comparisons between weak lensing and galaxy stellar profiles are a direct test of whether simulations build and deposit galaxy mass in the correct dark matter halos and thereby provide powerful constraints on the physics of feedback and galaxy growth.},

At fixed stellar mass, the satellite SHMR exhibits a distinct shift towards lower dynamical mass compared to the SHMR of centrals. Conversely, at fixed dynamical mass, satellite galaxies appear to have larger stellar-to-total mass fractions than centrals by up to a factor of a few. The systematic deviation from the central SHMR is larger for satellites in more massive hosts, at smaller cluster-centric distances, with earlier infall times, and that inhabit higher local density environments; moreover, it is in place already at early times (z {\textless} 2). Systematic environmental effects might contribute to the perceived galaxy-to-galaxy variation in the measured SHMR when galaxies cannot be separated into satellites and centrals. The SHMR of satellites exhibits a larger scatter than centrals, over the whole range of dynamical mass (by up to 0.8 dex). The shift of the satellite SHMR results mostly from tidal stripping of their dark matter, which affects satellites in an outside-in fashion: the departure of the satellite SHMR from the centrals' relation diminishes for measurements of dynamical mass in progressively smaller apertures. Finally, we provide a family of fitting functions for the SHMR predicted by IllustrisTNG.},

A Cosmic Web class (knot, filament, sheet, void) is assigned to each region of the volume using a density field deformation tensor-based method. We find that galaxy stellar mass strongly correlates with total dynamical mass and formation time, and more weakly with large-scale overdensity and Cosmic Web class. The latter two quantities correlate with each other, but are not entirely degenerate. Furthermore, we find that at fixed halo mass, galaxies with stellar mass lower than the median value are more likely to be found in voids and sheets, whereas galaxies with stellar mass higher than the median are more likely to be found in filaments and knots. Finally, we find that the dependence on environment is stronger for satellites than for centrals, and discuss the physical implications of these results.},

	abstract = {We examine the cosmic growth of the red sequence in a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation that includes a heuristic prescription for quenching star formation that yields a realistic passive galaxy population today. In this prescription, halos dominated by hot gas are continually heated to prevent their coronae from fueling new star formation. Hot coronae primarily form in halos above \sim10{\textasciicircum}12 M\odot, so that galaxies with stellar masses \sim10{\textasciicircum}10.5 M\odot are the first to be quenched and move onto the red sequence at z {\textgreater} 2. The red sequence is concurrently populated at low masses by satellite galaxies in large halos that are starved of new fuel, resulting in a dip in passive galaxy number densities around \sim10{\textasciicircum}10 M\odot. Stellar mass growth continues for galaxies even after joining the red sequence, primarily through minor mergers with a typical mass ratio \sim1:5. For the most massive systems, the size growth implied by the distribution of merger mass ratios is typically \sim2\times the corresponding mass growth, consistent with observations. This model reproduces mass-density and colour-density trends in the local universe, with essentially no evolution to z = 1, with the hint that such relations may be washed out by z \sim 2. Simulated galaxies are increasingly likely to be red at high masses or high local overdensities. In our model, the presence of surrounding hot gas drives the trends with both mass and environment.},

Realistic mock catalogues are also extracted from the lightcone of the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation Horizon-AGN. They show that the photometric redshift accuracy of the observed catalogue (\$\sigma\_z{\textless}0.015\$ at \$M\_*{\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}\{\rm M\}\_\{\odot\}\$ and \$z{\textless}0.9\$) is sufficient to provide 2D filaments that closely match their projected 3D counterparts. Transverse stellar mass gradients are measured in projected slices of thickness 75 Mpc between \$0.5{\textless} z {\textless}0.9\$, showing that the most massive galaxies are statistically closer to their neighbouring filament. At fixed stellar mass, passive galaxies are also found closer to their filament while active star-forming galaxies statistically lie further away. The contributions of nodes and local density are removed from these gradients to highlight the specific role played by the geometry of the filaments. We find that the measured signal does persist after this removal, clearly demonstrating that proximity to a filament is not equivalent to proximity to an over-density. These findings are in agreement with gradients measured both in 2D or 3D in the Horizon-AGN simulation and those observed in the spectroscopic VIPERS survey (which rely on the identification of 3D filaments). They are consistent with a picture in which the influence of the geometry of the large-scale environment drives anisotropic tides which impact the assembly history of galaxies, and hence their observed properties.},

We combine the classical 1/Vmax approach with STY, a parametric maximum likelihood method and SWML, a non-parametric maximum likelihood technique. In the parametric approach, we are assuming that the stellar mass function can be modelled by either a single or a double Schechter function and we use a likelihood ratio test to determine which model provides a better fit to the data. We discuss how the stellar mass completeness as a function of z biases the three estimators and how it can affect, especially the low mass end of the stellar mass function. We apply our method to SDSS DR7 data in the redshift range from 0.02 to 0.06. We find that the entire galaxy sample is best described by a double Schechter function with the following parameters: \$\log (M{\textasciicircum}\{*\}/M\_\odot) = 10.79 \pm 0.01\$, \$\log (\Phi{\textasciicircum}\{*\}\_1/\mathrm\{h{\textasciicircum}3\ Mpc{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\}) = -3.31 \pm 0.20\$, \$\alpha\_1 = -1.69 \pm 0.10\$, \$\log (\Phi{\textasciicircum}\{*\}\_2/\mathrm\{h{\textasciicircum}3\ Mpc{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\}) = -2.01 \pm 0.28\$ and \$\alpha\_2 = -0.79 \pm 0.04\$.

We show that the green valley between the blue cloud of star-forming galaxies and the red sequence of quiescent galaxies in the colour-mass diagram is not a single transitional state through which most blue galaxies evolve into red galaxies. Rather, an analysis that takes morphology into account makes clear that only a small population of blue early-type galaxies move rapidly across the green valley after the morphologies are transformed from disk to spheroid and star formation is quenched rapidly. In contrast, the majority of blue star-forming galaxies have significant disks, and they retain their late-type morphologies as their star formation rates decline very slowly. We summarize a range of observations that lead to these conclusions, including UV-optical colours and halo masses, which both show a striking dependence on morphological type. We interpret these results in terms of the evolution of cosmic gas supply and gas reservoirs. We conclude that late-type galaxies are consistent with a scenario where the cosmic supply of gas is shut off, perhaps at a critical halo mass, followed by a slow exhaustion of the remaining gas over several Gyr, driven by secular and/or environmental processes. In contrast, early-type galaxies require a scenario where the gas supply and gas reservoir are destroyed virtually instantaneously, with rapid quenching accompanied by a morphological transformation from disk to spheroid. This gas reservoir destruction could be the consequence of a major merger, which in most cases transforms galaxies from disk to elliptical morphology, and mergers could play a role in inducing black hole accretion and possibly AGN feedback.},

For massive galaxies, M*{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}10.6 Msol, our results indicate that star-forming galaxies grow proportionately as fast as their dark matter halos while quiescent galaxies are outpaced by dark matter growth. At lower masses, there is minimal difference in the SHMRs, implying that the majority low-mass quiescent galaxies have only recently been quenched of their star formation. Our analysis also affords a breakdown of all COSMOS galaxies into the relative numbers of central and satellite galaxies for both populations. At z=1, satellite galaxies dominate the red sequence below the knee in the stellar mass function. But the number of quiescent satellites exhibits minimal redshift evolution; all evolution in the red sequence is due to low-mass central galaxies being quenched of their star formation. At M*{\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}10 Msol, the fraction of central galaxies on the red sequence increases by a factor of ten over our redshift baseline, while the fraction of quenched satellite galaxies at that mass is constant with redshift. We define a "migration rate" to the red sequence as the time derivative of the passive galaxy abundances. We find that the migration rate of central galaxies to the red sequence increases by nearly an order of magnitude from z=1 to z=0. These results imply that the efficiency of quenching star formation for centrals is increasing with cosmic time, while the mechanisms that quench the star formation of satellite galaxies in groups and clusters is losing efficiency.},

The method is constrained by galaxies' observed stellar mass functions, SFRs (specific and cosmic), quenched fractions, UV luminosity functions, UV-SM relations, IRX-UV relations, auto- and cross-correlation functions (including quenched and star-forming subsamples), and quenching dependence on environment; each observable is reproduced over the full redshift range available, up to 0{\textless}z{\textless}10. Key findings include: galaxy assembly correlates strongly with halo assembly; quenching at z{\textgreater}1 correlates strongly with halo mass; quenched fractions at fixed halo mass decrease with increasing redshift; massive quenched galaxies reside in higher-mass haloes than star-forming galaxies at fixed galaxy mass; star-forming and quenched galaxies' star formation histories at fixed mass differ most at z{\textless}0.5; satellites have large scatter in quenching timescales after infall, and have modestly higher quenched fractions than central galaxies; Planck cosmologies result in up to 0.3 dex lower stellar mass-halo mass ratios at early times; and, nonetheless, stellar mass-halo mass ratios rise at z{\textgreater}5. Also presented are revised stellar mass-halo mass relations for all, quenched, star-forming, central, and satellite galaxies; the dependence of star formation histories on halo mass, stellar mass, and galaxy SSFR; quenched fractions and quenching timescale distributions for satellites; and predictions for higher-redshift galaxy correlation functions and weak lensing surface densities. The public data release (DR1) includes the massively parallel ({\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}5 cores) implementation (the UniverseMachine), the newly compiled and remeasured observational data, derived galaxy formation constraints, and mock catalogues including lightcones.},

Because gravitational lensing can make galaxies appear both brighter and larger, the presence of foreground inhomogeneities can scatter galaxies across not only magnitude cuts but also size cuts, changing the statistical properties of the resulting catalog. Here we explore this size bias, and how it combines with magnification bias to affect galaxy statistics. We demonstrate that photometric galaxy samples from current and upcoming surveys can be even more affected by size bias than by magnification bias.},

	abstract = {Using data from the COSMOS survey, we perform the first joint analysis of galaxy-galaxy weak lensing, galaxy spatial clustering, and galaxy number densities. Carefully accounting for sample variance and for scatter between stellar and halo mass, we model all three observables simultaneously using a novel and self-consistent theoretical framework. Our results provide strong constraints on the shape and redshift evolution of the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) from z=0.2 to z=1. At low stellar mass, we find that halo mass scales as Mh M*{\textasciicircum}0.46 and that this scaling does not evolve significantly with redshift to z=1. We show that the dark-to-stellar ratio, Mh/M*, varies from low to high masses, reaching a minimum of Mh/M*{\textasciitilde}27 at M*=4.5x10{\textasciicircum}10 Msun and Mh=1.2x10{\textasciicircum}12 Msun. This minimum is important for models of galaxy formation because it marks the mass at which the accumulated stellar growth of the central galaxy has been the most efficient. We describe the SHMR at this minimum in terms of the "pivot stellar mass", M*piv, the "pivot halo mass", Mhpiv, and the "pivot ratio", (Mh/M*)piv. Thanks to a homogeneous analysis of a single data set, we report the first detection of mass downsizing trends for both Mhpiv and M*piv. The pivot stellar mass decreases from M*piv=5.75+-0.13x10{\textasciicircum}10 Msun at z=0.88 to M*piv=3.55+-0.17x10{\textasciicircum}10 Msun at z=0.37. Intriguingly, however, the corresponding evolution of Mhpiv leaves the pivot ratio constant with redshift at (Mh/M*)piv{\textasciitilde}27. We use simple arguments to show how this result raises the possibility that star formation quenching may ultimately depend on Mh/M* and not simply Mh, as is commonly assumed. We show that simple models with such a dependence naturally lead to downsizing in the sites of star formation. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results in the context of popular quenching models, including disk instabilities and AGN feedback.},

	abstract = {We measure the luminosity and color dependence of galaxy clustering in the SDSS DR7 main galaxy sample, focusing on the projected correlation function w\_p(r\_p) of volume-limited samples. We interpret our measurements using halo occupation distribution (HOD) modeling assuming a Lambda-CDM cosmology. The amplitude of w\_p(r\_p) grows slowly with luminosity for L {\textless} L\_* and increases sharply at higher luminosities, with bias factor b({\textgreater}L)=1.06+0.23(L/L\_*){\textasciicircum}\{1.12\}. At fixed luminosity, redder galaxies have a stronger and steeper w\_p(r\_p), a trend that runs steadily from the bluest galaxies to the reddest galaxies. The individual luminosity trends for the red and blue galaxy populations are strikingly different. Blue galaxies show a slow but steady increase of w\_p(r\_p) with luminosity, at all scales. The large-scale clustering of red galaxies shows little luminosity dependence until a sharp increase at L {\textgreater} 4L\_*, but the lowest luminosity red galaxies (0.04-0.25 L\_*) show very strong clustering on scales r\_p {\textless} 2 Mpc/h. Most of the observed trends can be naturally understood within the LCDM+HOD framework. The growth of w\_p(r\_p) with luminosity reflects an overall shift in the halo mass scale, in particular an increase in the minimum host halo mass Mmin. The mass at which a halo has, on average, one satellite galaxy brighter than L is M\_1 {\textasciitilde} 17 Mmin(L) over most of the luminosity range. The growth and steepening of w\_p(r\_p) for redder galaxies reflects the increasing fraction of galaxies that are satellite systems in high mass halos instead of central systems in low mass halos, a trend that is especially marked at low luminosities. Our extensive measurements, provided in tabular form, will allow detailed tests of theoretical models of galaxy formation, a firm grounding of semi-empirical models of the galaxy population, and new cosmological tests.},

	abstract = {We model the luminosity-dependent projected two-point correlation function of DEEP2 (z{\textasciitilde}1) and SDSS (z{\textasciitilde}0) galaxies within the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) framework. At both epochs, there is a tight correlation between central galaxy luminosity and halo mass, with the slope and scatter decreasing for larger halo masses, and the fraction of satellite galaxies decreasing at higher luminosity. Central L* galaxies reside in halos a few times more massive at z{\textasciitilde}1 than at z{\textasciitilde}0. We find little evolution in the relation between mass scales of host halos for central galaxies and satellite galaxies above the same luminosity threshold. Combining these HOD results with theoretical predictions of the typical growth of halos, we establish an evolutionary connection between the galaxy populations at the two redshifts by linking z{\textasciitilde}0 central galaxies to z{\textasciitilde}1 central galaxies that reside in their progenitor halos, which enables us to study the evolution of galaxies as a function of halo mass. We find that the stellar mass growth of galaxies depends on halo mass. On average, the majority of the stellar mass in central galaxies residing in z{\textasciitilde}0 low mass halos ({\textasciitilde}5x10{\textasciicircum}11 Msun/h) and only a small fraction of the stellar mass in central galaxies of high mass halos ({\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}13 Msun/h) result from star formation between z{\textasciitilde}1 and z{\textasciitilde}0. In addition, the mass scale of halos where the star formation efficiency reaches a maximum is found to shift toward lower mass with time. Future work can combine HOD modeling of the clustering of galaxies at different redshifts with the assembly history and dynamical evolution of dark matter halos. This can lead to an understanding of the stellar mass growth due to both mergers and star formation as a function of host halo mass and provide powerful tests of galaxy formation theories.

	abstract = {The halo occupation distribution (HOD) describes the relation between galaxies and dark matter at the level of individual dark matter halos. The properties of galaxies residing at the centers of halos differ from those of satellite galaxies because of differences in their formation histories. Using a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation and a semi-analytic (SA) galaxy formation model, we examine the separate contributions of central and satellite galaxies to the HOD, more specifically to the probability P(N{\textbar}M) that a halo of virial mass M contains N galaxies of a particular class. In agreement with earlier results for dark matter subhalos, we find that the mean occupation function {\textless}N{\textgreater} for galaxies above a baryonic mass threshold can be approximated by a step function for central galaxies plus a power law for satellites, and that the distribution of satellite numbers is close to Poisson at fixed halo mass. For galaxy samples defined by different baryonic mass thresholds, there is a nearly linear relation between the minimum halo mass Mmin required to host a central galaxy and the mass M1 at which an average halo hosts one satellite, with M1 {\textasciitilde} 14 Mmin (SPH) or M1 {\textasciitilde} 18 Mmin (SA). The mean occupation number of young galaxies exhibits a local minimum at M {\textasciitilde} 10 Mmin where halos are too massive to host a young central galaxy but not massive enough to host satellites. We show that the conditional galaxy mass function at fixed halo mass cannot be described by a Schechter function because central galaxies produce a "bump" at high masses. We suggest parameterizations for the HOD and the conditional luminosity function that can be used to model observed galaxy clustering. Many of our predictions are in good agreement with recent results inferred from clustering in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.},

Our measurements allow us to place constraints on the redshift dependence of the mass-observable relation for tSZ cluster count analyses in terms of the so-called 'hydrostatic mass bias' parameter \$1-b\_\{\rm H\}\$. These results can also be interpreted as measurements of the bias-weighted average gas pressure \$\langle bP\_e\rangle\$ as a function of redshift, a quantity that can be related to the thermodynamics of gas inside haloes and used to constrain energy injection processes. We measure \$1-b\_\{\rm H\}\$ with \$\sim6\\%\$ precision in 6 equispaced redshift bins, and find no evidence for a redshift-dependent mass bias parameter, in agreement with previous analyses. Our mean value of \$1-b\_\{\rm H\} = 0.75\pm0.03\$ is also in good agreement with the one estimated by the joint analysis of Planck cluster counts and CMB anisotropies calibrated with CMB lensing. Our measurements of \$\langle bP\_e\rangle\$, at the level of \$\sim10\\%\$ in each bin, are the most stringent constraints on the redshift dependence of this parameter to date, and agree well both with previous measurements and with theoretical expectations from shock-heating models.},

abstract = {With their high angular resolutions of 30â100 mas, large fields of view, and complex optical systems, imagers on next-generation optical/near-infrared space observatories, such as the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) on the James Webb Space Telescope, present new opportunities for science and also new challenges for empirical point-spread function (PSF) characterization. In this context, we introduce ShOpt, a new PSF fitting tool developed in Julia and designed to bridge the advanced features of PSFs in the full field of view (PIFF) with the computational efficiency of PSF Extractor (PSFEx). Along with ShOpt, we propose a suite of nonparametric statistics suitable for evaluating PSF fit quality in space-based imaging. Our study benchmarks ShOpt against the established PSF fitters PSFEx and PIFF using real and simulated COSMOS-Web Survey imaging. We assess their respective PSF model fidelity with our proposed diagnostic statistics and investigate their computational efficiencies, focusing on their processing speed relative to the complexity and size of the PSF models. We find that ShOpt can already achieve PSF model fidelity comparable to PSFEx and PIFF while maintaining competitive processing speeds, constructing PSF models for large NIRCam mosaics within minutes.}
